Abstract
"IMPORTANCE: Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) are an important group of 
pollutants associated with endocrine disorders, cancer, and nephrotoxicity. 
However, temporal trends in OPFR metabolite concentrations remain understudied.
OBJECTIVES: To examine changes in urinary concentrations of OPFR metabolites 
among US children, youths, and adults from 2011 to 2020, and to evaluate whether 
sociodemographic factors were associated with variations in temporal trends.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cross-sectional study 
used data from 4 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
cycles (2011-2012, 2013-2014, 2015-2016, and 2017-2020 [to March 2020 before the 
COVID-19 pandemic]). The study included children and youths (aged 6-19 years) 
and adults (aged ≥20 years) with valid urinary concentrations of the following 
OPFR metabolites: bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (BCEtP), bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) 
phosphate (BCPP), diphenyl phosphate (DPhP), and dibutyl phosphate (DBuP). Data 
analysis was performed between February and May 2024.
EXPOSURES: Calendar year and key sociodemographic subgroups (age, race and 
ethnicity, sex, educational attainment, and poverty-to-income ratio).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was urinary concentrations of OPFR 
metabolites among children, youths, and adults. Survey-weighted linear 
regression models were applied to estimate trends.
RESULTS: The study population of 10 549 NHANES participants included 3154 
children and youths (mean [SE] age, 12.5 [0.1] years; 51.2% were male) and 7395 
adults (mean [SE] age, 47.8 [0.4] years; 52.0% were women). Among children and 
youths, mean (95% CI) BCEtP concentrations decreased from 0.68 (0.60-0.77) μg/L 
in 2011-2012 to 0.41 (0.37-0.45) μg/L in 2017-2020 (P for trend < .001). Among 
adults, mean (95% CI) BCEtP concentrations decreased from 0.43 (0.37-0.50) μg/L 
in 2011-2012 to 0.29 (0.27-0.33) μg/L in 2017-2020 (P for trend < .001), and 
mean BCPP concentrations decreased from 0.15 (0.14-0.17) μg/L to 0.13 
(0.12-0.14) μg/L (P for trend = .002). Parent level of educational attainment 
was associated with concentrations of BCPP and BCEtP among children and youths; 
however, no significant differences among adults were observed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study identified variations in temporal trends 
in urinary concentrations of OPFR metabolites among the US population from 2011 
to 2020. In addition, substantial disparities in exposure levels persisted among 
children with different levels of parent educational attainment. These findings 
suggest that policy makers should consider socioeconomic factors to further 
reduce OPFR exposure and promote equity, ensuring a safe living environment for 
all individuals."

"We investigated the effects of 35 inflammatory cytokines on respiratory 
outcomes, including COVID-19, asthma (atopic and non-atopic), chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary function indices, using 
Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses. The emerging associations 
were further explored using observational analyses in the UK Biobank. We found 
an inverse association between genetically predicted macrophage colony 
stimulating factor (MCSF), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM), 
and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 with risk of COVID-19 outcomes. 
sICAM was positively associated with atopic asthma risk, whereas tumor necrosis 
factor-alfa showed an inverse association. A positive association was shown 
between interleukin-18 and COPD risk (replicated in observational analysis), 
whereas an inverse association was shown for interleukin-1 receptor antagonist 
(IL-1ra). IL-1ra and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 were positively associated 
with lung function indices, whereas inverse associations were shown for MCSF and 
interleukin-18 (replicated in observational analysis). Our results point to 
these cytokines as potential pharmacological targets for respiratory traits."

"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused over 
600 million confirmed infections and more than 6.8 million deaths worldwide, 
with ongoing implications for human health. COVID-19 has been extensively 
documented to have extrapulmonary manifestations due to the widespread 
expression of necessary ACE2 receptors in the human body. Nevertheless, the 
association between COVID-19 and cancer risk remains inadequately explored. This 
study employs Mendelian randomization (MR) methods to examine the causal 
relationship between genetic variations associated with COVID-19 and the risk of 
developing cancer. The findings indicate that COVID-19 has negligible impact on 
most cancer risks. Interestingly, a higher COVID-19 impact is associated with a 
decreased risk of thyroid cancer. In summary, our findings demonstrate a genetic 
correlation between COVID-19 and thyroid cancer, contributing to our 
understanding of the interplay between COVID-19 and cancer risk."

"INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer screening (LCS) reduces lung cancer mortality, yet 
uptake pre- and post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains low. The impact 
of COVID-19 on LCS programs across the United States is unknown. Ours is the 
first multi-institutional study to identify barriers to LCS experienced during 
the pandemic. Our work will hopefully inform the development of targeted 
resources to facilitate increased uptake of LCS.
METHODS: A nationwide survey of Centers of Excellence (SCOE) in LCS was 
conducted by GO2 for Lung Cancer Foundation. In 2021, survey items included 
questions regarding program structure, screening rates, and systemic barriers to 
LCS delivery experienced amid COVID-19.
RESULTS: A total of 99 programs representing 1112 screening sites responded. A 
median of 868 patients were screened during the year of 2020. Patient 
recruitment, patient education, and in-person service access were negatively 
affected by COVID-19, whereas the use of telemedicine was positively affected. 
Coordination of care and timely reporting of results were largely unaffected by 
the pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a real-world snapshot of how COVID-19 affected 
LCS from a program perspective. These findings highlight ongoing challenges with 
educating and engaging those at high risk for lung cancer in LCS. Program 
resources should be directed toward increasing adherence to LCS among eligible 
patients."

"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of acupuncture combined 
with bloodletting therapy and Qingwen Xiere decoction in mild to moderate 
COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: A total of 100 mild to moderate COVID-19 patients collected from 
December 2022 to February 2023 were randomly divided into control and 
observation groups, with 50 patients in each group. Patients in the control 
group received oral Qingwen Xiere decoction for 6 days. The observation group 
received acupuncture combined with bloodletting therapy in addition to oral 
Qingwen Xiere decoction, with the acupuncture (at Kongzui ［LU6］, Hegu ［LI4］, 
Quchi ［LI11］, Feishu ［BL13］, Zhongwan ［CV12］, Qihai ［CV6］, Yinlingquan ［SP9］) 
administered 30 min each day for 6 days, and bloodletting (at Shaoshang ［LU11］, 
Shangyang ［LI1］, Dazhui ［GV14］) administered every other day for 3 times. 
Traditional Chinese medicine syndrome scores and pulmonary CT scores were 
recorded before and after treatment. Serum contents of C-reactive protein (CRP), 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were measured 
using ELISA. Anxiety and depression degree were assessed using the Hamilton 
Depression Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Safety of the 
treatments was evaluated in both groups.
RESULTS: Compared with before treatment, after treatment, the control group 
showed improvement in fever, dry cough, sore throat, and total traditional 
Chinese medicine syndrome scores (P<0.01), but no significant improvement in 
muscle pain or fatigue；the observation group showed significant improvement in 
total traditional Chinese medicine syndrome and individual symptoms scores 
(P<0.01)；both groups demonstrated reductions in pulmonary CT scores, HAMA score, 
HAMD score and serum contents of CRP and IL-6 (P<0.01)；serum TNF-α content 
significantly decreased in the observation group (P<0.01). All outcome measures 
were superior in the observation group to the control group (P<0.01, P<0.05). No 
adverse reactions were reported in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture combined with bloodletting therapy and oral Qingwen 
Xiere decoction effectively improves clinical symptoms, alleviates pulmonary 
inflammatory injury, reduces inflammatory cytokine contents, and mitigates 
anxiety and depression in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients, and without 
adverse effects."
