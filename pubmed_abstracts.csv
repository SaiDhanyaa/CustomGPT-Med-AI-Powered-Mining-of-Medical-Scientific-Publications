"BACKGROUND: Telehealth played a critical role during the COVID-19 pandemic and 
continues to function as an essential component of health care. Existing 
platforms cannot ensure privacy and prevent cyberattacks.
OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of this study are to understand existing 
cybersecurity issues in identity management and trustworthy communication 
processes in telehealth platforms and to design a software architecture 
integrated with blockchain to improve security and trustworthiness with 
acceptable performance.
METHODS: We improved personal information security in existing telehealth 
platforms by adopting an innovative interdisciplinary approach combining design 
science, social science, and computer science in the health care domain, with 
prototype implementation. We used the design science research methodology to 
implement our overall design. We innovated over existing telehealth platforms 
with blockchain integration that improves health care delivery services in terms 
of security, privacy, and efficiency. We adopted a user-centric design approach 
and started with user requirement collection, followed by system functionality 
development. Overall system implementation facilitates user requirements, thus 
promoting user behavior for the adoption of the telehealth platform with 
decentralized identity management and an access control mechanism.
RESULTS: Our investigation identified key challenges to identity management and 
trustworthy communication processes in telehealth platforms used in the current 
health care domain. By adopting distributed ledger technology, we proposed a 
decentralized telehealth platform to support identity management and a 
trustworthy communication process. Our design and prototype implementation using 
a smart contract-driven telehealth platform to provide decentralized identity 
management and trustworthy communication with token-based access control 
addressed several security challenges. This was substantiated by testing with 
10,000 simulated transactions across 5 peers in the Rahasak blockchain network. 
The proposed design provides resistance to common attacks while maintaining a 
linear time overhead, demonstrating improved security and efficiency in 
telehealth services. We evaluated the performance in terms of transaction 
throughput, smart contract execution time, and block generation time. To create 
a block with 10,000 transactions, it takes 8 seconds on average, which is an 
acceptable overhead for blockchain-based applications.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified technical limitations in current telehealth 
platforms. We presented several design innovations using blockchain to prototype 
a system. We also presented the implementation details of a unique distributed 
architecture for a trustworthy communication system. We illustrated how this 
design can overcome privacy, security, and scalability limitations. Moreover, we 
illustrated how improving these factors sets the stage for improving and 
standardizing the application and for the wide adoption of blockchain-enabled 
telehealth platforms."

"IMPORTANCE: Previous studies have identified mutations in SARS-CoV-2 strains 
that confer resistance to nirmatrelvir, yet how often this resistance arises and 
its association with posttreatment virologic rebound is not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of emergent antiviral resistance after 
nirmatrelvir treatment and its association with virologic rebound.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study enrolled outpatient adults 
with acute COVID-19 infection from May 2021 to October 2023. Participants were 
divided into those who received antiviral therapy and those who did not. The 
study was conducted at a multicenter health care system in Boston, 
Massachusetts.
EXPOSURE: Treatment regimen, including none, nirmatrelvir, and remdesivir.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was emergent SARS-CoV-2 
antiviral resistance, defined as the detection of antiviral resistance 
mutations, which were not present at baseline, were previously associated with 
decreased antiviral efficacy, and emerged during or after completion of a 
participant's treatment. Next-generation sequencing was used to detect low 
frequency mutations down to 1% of the total viral population.
RESULTS: Overall, 156 participants (114 female [73.1%]; median [IQR] age, 56 
[38-69] years) were included. Compared with 63 untreated individuals, the 79 who 
received nirmatrelvir were older and more commonly immunosuppressed. After 
sequencing viral RNA from participants' anterior nasal swabs, nirmatrelvir 
resistance mutations were detected in 9 individuals who received nirmatrelvir 
(11.4%) compared with 2 of those who did not (3.2%) (P = .09). Among the 
individuals treated with nirmatrelvir, those who were immunosuppressed had the 
highest frequency of resistance emergence (5 of 22 [22.7%]), significantly 
greater than untreated individuals (2 of 63 [3.1%]) (P = .01). Similar rates of 
nirmatrelvir resistance were found in those who had virologic rebound (3 of 23 
[13.0%]) vs those who did not (6 of 56 [10.7%]) (P = .86). Most of these 
mutations (10 of 11 [90.9%]) were detected at low frequencies (<20% of viral 
population) and reverted to the wild type at subsequent time points. Emerging 
remdesivir resistance mutations were only detected in immunosuppressed 
individuals (2 of 14 [14.3%]) but were similarly low frequency and transient. 
Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data analysis showed no evidence of 
increased nirmatrelvir resistance in the United States after the authorization 
of nirmatrelvir.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of 156 participants, 
treatment-emergent nirmatrelvir resistance mutations were commonly detected, 
especially in individuals who were immunosuppressed. However, these mutations 
were generally present at low frequencies and were transient in nature, 
suggesting a low risk for the spread of nirmatrelvir resistance in the community 
with the current variants and drug usage patterns."

"IMPORTANCE: Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) are an important group of 
pollutants associated with endocrine disorders, cancer, and nephrotoxicity. 
However, temporal trends in OPFR metabolite concentrations remain understudied.
OBJECTIVES: To examine changes in urinary concentrations of OPFR metabolites 
among US children, youths, and adults from 2011 to 2020, and to evaluate whether 
sociodemographic factors were associated with variations in temporal trends.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cross-sectional study 
used data from 4 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
cycles (2011-2012, 2013-2014, 2015-2016, and 2017-2020 [to March 2020 before the 
COVID-19 pandemic]). The study included children and youths (aged 6-19 years) 
and adults (aged ≥20 years) with valid urinary concentrations of the following 
OPFR metabolites: bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (BCEtP), bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) 
phosphate (BCPP), diphenyl phosphate (DPhP), and dibutyl phosphate (DBuP). Data 
analysis was performed between February and May 2024.
EXPOSURES: Calendar year and key sociodemographic subgroups (age, race and 
ethnicity, sex, educational attainment, and poverty-to-income ratio).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was urinary concentrations of OPFR 
metabolites among children, youths, and adults. Survey-weighted linear 
regression models were applied to estimate trends.
RESULTS: The study population of 10 549 NHANES participants included 3154 
children and youths (mean [SE] age, 12.5 [0.1] years; 51.2% were male) and 7395 
adults (mean [SE] age, 47.8 [0.4] years; 52.0% were women). Among children and 
youths, mean (95% CI) BCEtP concentrations decreased from 0.68 (0.60-0.77) μg/L 
in 2011-2012 to 0.41 (0.37-0.45) μg/L in 2017-2020 (P for trend < .001). Among 
adults, mean (95% CI) BCEtP concentrations decreased from 0.43 (0.37-0.50) μg/L 
in 2011-2012 to 0.29 (0.27-0.33) μg/L in 2017-2020 (P for trend < .001), and 
mean BCPP concentrations decreased from 0.15 (0.14-0.17) μg/L to 0.13 
(0.12-0.14) μg/L (P for trend = .002). Parent level of educational attainment 
was associated with concentrations of BCPP and BCEtP among children and youths; 
however, no significant differences among adults were observed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study identified variations in temporal trends 
in urinary concentrations of OPFR metabolites among the US population from 2011 
to 2020. In addition, substantial disparities in exposure levels persisted among 
children with different levels of parent educational attainment. These findings 
suggest that policy makers should consider socioeconomic factors to further 
reduce OPFR exposure and promote equity, ensuring a safe living environment for 
all individuals."

"PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the repeatability of corneal densitometry (CD) 
measurements obtained using both an anterior-segment optical coherence 
tomography (AS-OCT) device and a Scheimpflug camera system, while also assessing 
the level of agreement. The study also sought to investigate the correlation of 
CD with age, gender, and central corneal thickness (CCT) in normal eyes.
METHODS: CD measurements were obtained using the Casia 2 and the Pentacam AXL 
Wave. Data were collected on Total Corneal Densitometry and 4 concentric corneal 
annular areas, these are referred to as zone 1, denoting the central area, 
through to zone 4, designating the outermost peripheral region. Repeatability 
was assessed using intra-session test-retest variability, coefficient of 
variation (CoV), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The agreement was 
evaluated using Bland-Altman plots. Correlation analysis was performed between 
CD, age, gender, and CCT.
RESULTS: The study included 96 healthy volunteers. The Casia 2 demonstrated high 
repeatability with ICC values exceeding 0.9 in all the corneal zones and lower 
CoV values compared to the Pentacam AXL Wave (ranging from 1.07% to 2.25% for 
Casia 2 and from 1.91% to 6.89% for Pentacam).95% LoA were within ± 2 standard 
deviation from the average mean except from zone 1 (± 2.42).However, the 
measurements showed a consistent bias among all the corneal zones. CD values 
were positively correlated with age, except for zone 1 with the Pentacam 
(p = 0.083).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the Casia 2 can be a reliable tool for 
assessing corneal transparency in healthy individuals, however its measurements 
are not interchangeable with those provided by the Pentacam. The AS-OCT device 
may be more sensitive in detecting subtle age-related changes in CD within the 
central zone."

"On 19 January 2020, the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was identified in the United States, with 
the first cases in South Carolina confirmed on 06 March 2020. Due to initial 
limited testing capabilities and potential for asymptomatic transmission, it is 
possible that SARS-CoV-2 may have been present earlier than previously thought, 
while the immune status of at-risk populations was unknown. Saliva from 55 South 
Carolina emergency healthcare workers (EHCWs) was collected from September 2019 
to March 2020, pre- and post-healthcare shifts, and stored frozen. To determine 
the presence of SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies, saliva-acquired post-shift was 
analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a repeat of positive 
or inconclusive results and follow-up testing of pre-shift samples. Two 
participants were positive for SARS-CoV-2 N/S1-reactive IgG, confirmed by 
follow-up testing, with S1 receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG present in 
one individual. Positive samples were collected from medical students working in 
emergency medical services (EMSs) in October or November 2019. The presence of 
detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 2019 suggests that immune responses to 
the virus existed in South Carolina, and the United States, in a small 
percentage of EHCWs prior to the earliest documented coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) cases. These findings suggest the feasibility of saliva as a 
noninvasive tool for surveillance of emerging outbreaks, and EHCWs represent a 
high-risk population that should be the focus of infectious disease 
surveillance."

"Since early 2022, routine testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on symptoms and exposure history has largely 
ceased in Canada. Consequently, seroprevalence studies, particularly 
longitudinal studies, have become critical for monitoring the rate of incident 
SARS-CoV-2 infections and the proportion of the population with evidence of 
immunity. EnCORE is a longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study comprising 
five rounds of serology testing from October 2020 to June 2023, in a sample of 
2- to 17-year-olds (at baseline), recruited from daycares and schools in four 
neighbourhoods of Montreal, Canada. We report on SARS-CoV-2 incidence and 
seroprevalence among the 509 participants in the fifth and final round of the 
study. Seroprevalence of antibodies from either infection or vaccination was 98% 
(95 per cent confidence interval [CI]: 97, 99). The infection-acquired 
seroprevalence was 78% (95% CI: 73-82), and the incidence rate was 113 per 100 
person-years (95% CI: 94-132), compared to the seroprevalence of 58% and the 
incidence rate of 133 per 100 person-years, respectively, in the fourth round of 
testing (mid-late 2022). Of the 131 participants newly seropositive for 
infection in Round 4, only 18 were seronegative for infection in Round 5 (median 
follow-up: 326 days)."

"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has underscored the necessity for functional transgenic 
animal models for testing. Mouse lines with overexpression of the human receptor 
ACE2 serve as the common animal model to study COVID-19 infection. 
Overexpression of ACE2 under a strong ubiquitous promoter facilitates convenient 
and sensitive testing of COVID-19 pathology. We performed pronuclear 
microinjections using a 5 kb CAG-ACE2 linear transgene construct and identified 
three founder lines with 140, 72, and 73 copies, respectively. Two of these 
lines were further analyzed for ACE2 expression profiles and sensitivity to 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both lines expressed ACE2 in all organs analyzed. 
Embryonic fibroblast cell lines derived from transgenic embryos demonstrated 
severe cytopathic effects following infection, even at low doses of SARS-CoV-2 
(0,1-1.0 TCID50). Infected mice from the two lines began to show COVID-19 
clinical signs three days post-infection and succumbed between days 4 and 7. 
Histological examination of lung tissues from terminally ill mice revealed 
severe pathological alterations. To further characterize the integration site in 
one of the lines, we applied nanopore sequencing combined with Cas9 enrichment 
to examine the internal transgene concatemer structure. Oxford Nanopore 
sequencing (ONT) is becoming the gold standard for transgene insert 
characterization, but it is relatively inefficient without targeted region 
enrichment. We digested genomic DNA with Cas9 and gRNA against the ACE2 
transgene to create ends suitable for ONT adapter ligation. ONT data analysis 
revealed that most of the transgene copies were arranged in a head-to-tail 
configuration, with palindromic junctions being rare. We also detected 
occasional plasmid backbone fragments within the concatemer, likely co-purified 
during transgene gel extraction, which is a common occurrence in pronuclear 
microinjections."

"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Most long coronavirus disease (long COVID) studies rely on 
traditional surveillance methods that miss underserved populations who use 
emergency departments (EDs) as their primary health care source. In medically 
underserved ED populations, we sought to determine (1) whether there are gaps in 
awareness and self-declared understanding about long COVID illness, and (2) the 
prevalence, impact on school/work attendance, and receipt of care for long COVID 
symptoms.
METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional, convenience sample survey study of 
adult patients at 11 geographically representative US EDs from December 2022 to 
October 2023. Awareness and self-declared understanding about long COVID illness 
were measured. Prevalence, impact on school/work attendance, and receipt of care 
for long COVID symptoms were also assessed.
RESULTS: Of 1,618 eligible patients, 1455 (89.9%) agreed to participate, 
including 33.4% African Americans and 30.9% Latino/a. Of the patients, 17.1% 
lacked primary care. In total, 33.2% had persistent COVID-19 symptoms lasting >1 
month, and 20.3% had symptoms >3 months. Moreover, 49.8% with long COVID 
symptoms missed work/school because of symptoms; 30.3% of all participants and 
33.5% of participants who had long COVID symptoms had prior awareness and 
self-declared understanding of long COVID. Characteristics associated with poor 
understanding of long COVID were African American race (adjusted odds ratio 
[aOR] 3.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.66 to 5.09) and Latino/a ethnicity 
(aOR 3.16, 95% CI 2.15 to 4.64). Participants lacking primary care were less 
likely to have received long COVID care (24.6% versus 51.2%; difference 26.6%; 
95% CI 13.7% to 36.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite high prevalence and impact on school/work attendance of 
long COVID symptoms, most of this ED population had limited awareness and 
self-declared understanding of long COVID, and many had not received care. EDs 
should consider the development of protocols for diagnosis, education, and 
treatment of long COVID illness."

"BACKGROUND: Data on the outcomes of COVID-19 in people living with HIV (PLHIV), 
specifically in relation to vaccination status, are lacking during the Omicron 
era.
METHODS: This nationwide registry-based study included all resident in Sweden 
≥18 years with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test during January 2021-February 2023. 
We estimated adjusted odds ratios (adjOR) for COVID-19 hospitalisation and 
severe COVID-19 (ICU admission and 90-day mortality), categorised by SARS-CoV-2 
vaccination status (0-1, 2, and ≥3 doses), and HIV-status. Analyses were then 
categorised by time periods of pre-Omicron, Omicron during public testing, and 
Omicron after public testing.
RESULTS: 1348 PLHIV and 1 669 389 people without HIV (PWoH) were included. PLHIV 
were older, more migrant (65 vs. 22%) and male (59 vs. 46%). Of PLHIV, 96% were 
on antiretroviral treatment and 94% virally suppressed. AdjORs of COVID-19 
hospitalisation were similar irrespective of HIV-status, controlled for 
demographics, calendar month of infection, comorbidities, and income. PLHIV were 
more likely to be hospitalised than PWoH during Omicron and public testing 
(adjOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.2), but not after public testing. The odds of severe 
COVID-19 were three times higher in PLHIV compared to PWoH vaccinated with 2 
doses (adjOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-6.9), but not when vaccinated with ≥3 doses (adjOR 
0.7, 95% CI 0.2-1.6). Migrant and low nadir CD4+ T-cells were associated with 
higher odds of hospitalisation in unvaccinated PLHIV.
CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study, including mostly well-treated PLHIV, 
highlights the importance of vaccination with booster dose/s for effective 
protection against severe COVID-19 in PLHIV.KEY POINTPeople living with HIV 
compared to people without HIV did not have higher odds of COVID-19 
hospitalisation irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status (0-1 dose, 2 
doses, ≥3 doses) when adjusting for known risk factors including comorbidities 
and socioeconomic status."

"Infectious healthcare waste (IHCW) poses a significant biohazard and public 
health risk. This study examines IHCW formation and influencing factors in 
Hungarian inpatient healthcare institutions. Factors such as hospital type, 
regional location, indicators related to patient traffic, educational activity, 
patients of certain types of medical specialties, and healthcare-associated 
infections (HAIs) were examined. Univariate and multivariate statistical methods 
identified significant predictors of IHCW occurrence. The generation rate of 
IHCW ranged from 0.15 to 0.81 kg/bed/day nationally, and it increased by 40.74% 
between 2017 and 2021, significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The data 
also showed that as the number of beds increased, the IHCW production rate 
increased proportionally. The results indicate that IHCW generation rates vary 
significantly by hospital type, with university hospitals producing the most 
waste. The incidence of HAI multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections 
emerged as the primary driver of IHCW generation, along with educational 
activity, the number of intensive care unit patients, and regional differences. 
The Southern Great Plain region had the highest IHCW production 
(0,42 kg/bed/day) among the seven regions studied. The study highlights the 
critical impact of HAI MDR infections on IHCW production, emphasizing the need 
for targeted waste management in high-risk areas. Regional differences indicate 
the necessity for tailored strategies to address local waste management 
challenges. This study provides essential insights into IHCW formation and 
influencing factors in Hungary, offering valuable information for policy and 
practice.Implication statementNowadays, one of the main problems related to 
waste management is the uncontrollable amount of waste generated in the 
healthcare sector. Infectious healthcare waste (IHCW) represents a significant 
biological hazard and a high public health risk, both on an individual and a 
community level, so a more precise knowledge of these risks is extremely 
important.In the Central European region, very few studies have dealt with the 
infectious waste generated in the healthcare sector, and this is the first such 
research in Hungary. The primary aim of this study is to measure the amount of 
IHCW produced in various regions and hospital types in Hungary, and to examine 
the general and specific factors that affect the generation rate of this 
waste.The findings reveal that IHCW generation rates (GR) vary considerably 
across different hospital types and regions. This highlights the need for 
targeted waste management practices in individual institutions. In addition, the 
study emphasizes the importance of developing region-specific waste management 
strategies in view of regional inequalities. A crucial insight from the study is 
that the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), particularly 
multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections, has the most significant impact 
on IHCW GR, surpassing other known factors. This suggests that effective control 
of HAIs, especially MDR bacterial infections, can lead to a substantial 
reduction in IHCW. The study also showed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic not 
only on the production of IHCW, but also on individual influencing 
factors.Overall, the study provides valuable insights for informing policy and 
practice. By understanding the specific factors influencing IHCW production, 
policymakers and healthcare practitioners can develop more effective waste 
management policies and practices. This highlights the need for tailored waste 
management strategies that take into account the unique characteristics of each 
hospital type and geographic region, ultimately reducing the healthcare waste 
burden and providing a healthier and safer environment for all."

"The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected individuals with chronic 
conditions, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The full extent of the 
impact however remains unknown, mainly due to the limited research availability. 
This study examines the pandemic's impact on T2DM diagnosis and management in 
the United States. The methods include a literature review and an online survey 
of American healthcare professionals regarding their experiences of T2DM during 
the pandemic. Findings indicated significant reductions in healthcare 
utilisation among T2DM patients and a decline in the quality of care for this 
population. These reductions may have been attributed to fewer HbA1C tests being 
performed and emergency department visits, with a high proportion of individuals 
experiencing uncontrolled diabetes and receiving treatment intensification, 
especially among racial/ethnic minority groups, rural populations, and those 
with comorbidities. Effective strategies are needed to support T2DM regular 
follow-up and self-management, tailored to patient needs and culturally 
appropriated. Technologies like telemedicine can help address these needs, 
potentially reducing healthcare costs and improving clinical outcomes and 
quality of life for people with T2DM."

"COVID-19 commonly presents as pneumonia, with those most severely affected 
progressing to respiratory failure. Patient responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection 
are varied, with comorbidities acting as contributors to varied outcomes. 
Focusing on one such major comorbidity, we assessed whether pharmacological 
induction of Type I Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) would increase the severity of lung 
injury in a murine model of COVID-19 pneumonia utilizing wild type mice infected 
with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. Hyperglycemic mice exhibited increased weight 
loss and reduced blood oxygen saturation in comparison to their euglycemic 
counterparts, suggesting that these animals indeed experienced more severe lung 
injury. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant impairment of the 
adaptive immune response in the lungs of diabetic mice compared to those of 
control. In order to expand the options available for tissue analysis due to 
biosafety restrictions, we employed a new technique to digest highly fixed 
tissue into a single cell suspension, originally designed for scRNA-Seq, which 
we then adapted for flow cytometric analysis. Flow immunophenotyping and 
scRNA-Seq confirmed impaired recruitment of T cells into the lungs of T1DM 
animals. Additionally, scRNA-Seq revealed a distinct, highly inflammatory 
macrophage profile in the diabetic cohort that correlates with the more severe 
infection these mice experienced clinically, allowing insight into a possible 
mechanism for this phenomenon. Recognizing the near certainty that respiratory 
viruses will continue to present significant public health concerns for the 
foreseeable future, our study provides key insights into how T1DM results in a 
much more severe infection and identifies possible targets to ameliorate 
comorbidity-associated severe disease."

"We aimed to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of non-severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) respiratory pathogens among 
patients with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in Shijiazhuang, China, during 
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (January 2021--December 2022) 
and after the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictive measures (January 
2022--December 2023). This retrospective study enrolled 6,633 ARIs patients who 
visited the Hebei General Hospital between 2021- and 2023. Nasopharyngeal swabs 
samples were collected for multiplex PCR detection of 13 common respiratory 
pathogens. Respiratory pathogens were detected in 31.58% of individuals 
diagnosed with ARIs, whileereas a co-infection with multiple pathogens was 
observed in 8.5% of the ARI patients. In the years 2021 and 2022, 326 (27.63%) 
and 283 (24.38%) respiratory pathogens were found to be positive, respectively, 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in 2023, subsequent to the easing of 
COVID-19 restrictions, the positivity rate significantly rose to 34.62%, with 
4,292 cases identified. The majority of positive cases over the last three3 
years were concentrated in patients under 14 years old. The predominant 
pathogens identified were human rhinovirus (HRVs) (15.08%) in 2021, mycoplasma 
pneumonia (MP) (6.46%) in 2022, and influenza A virus (FluA) (11.35%) in 2023. 
Seasonal prevalence patterns of most pathogens were affected, except for 
parainfluenza virus (PIV). There was a simultaneous increase in the positive 
cases and positivity rates of FluA and adenovirus (ADV) Iin 2023, compared to 
2021 and 2022. Additionally, the infection rates of respiratory syncytial virus 
(RSV), MP, and coronavirus (CoV) in 2023 either exceeded or were comparable to 
those in 2021 and 2022. Conversely, the positivity rates of PIV, RVs, 
metapneumovirus (MPV), and influenza B virus (FluB) were lower in 2023 compared 
to 2021 or 2022.
IMPORTANCE: The implementation of strict non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) 
during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may lead to changes in 
the epidemiological features of respiratory pathogens, as well as the occurrence 
of immune debt, potentially causing a resurgence in respiratory pathogen 
activity following the easing of strict NPIs measures. There are limited reports 
on the epidemiological characteristics of respiratory pathogens among patients 
of all ages with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) during the COVID-19 
pandemic and after the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Our study investigated 
the epidemiology of 13 respiratory pathogens in Shijiazhuang, China, from 
January 2021 to December 2023. Thisese data isare crucial for the ongoing 
surveillance of epidemiological shifts in respiratory pathogens during and post 
the -COVID-19 pandemic, and serves as a scientific foundation for the prevention 
and management of ARIs."

"BACKGROUND: In 2022, publicly funded influenza vaccine was made available to all 
residents of Queensland, Australia. This study compared influenza epidemiology 
in 2022 with previous years (2017-2021) and estimated influenza vaccine 
effectiveness (VE) during 2022.
METHODS: The study involved a descriptive analysis of influenza notifications 
and a case-control study to estimate VE. Cases were notifications of 
laboratory-confirmed influenza, and controls were individuals who were test 
negative for COVID-19. Cases and controls were matched on age, postcode and 
specimen collection date. VE against hospitalisation was investigated by 
matching hospitalised cases to controls. Conditional logistic regression models 
were adjusted for sex.
RESULTS: In 2022, Queensland experienced an early influenza season onset 
(April-May) and high case numbers (n = 45,311), compared to the previous 5 years 
(annual average: 29,364) and 2020-2021 (2020:6047; 2021:301) during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Adjusted VE (VEadj) against laboratory-confirmed influenza was 39% 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 37-41), highest for children aged 30 months to < 
5 years (61%, 95% CI: 49-70) and lowest for adults aged ≥ 65 years (24%, 95% CI: 
17-30). VEadj against influenza-associated hospitalisation was 54% (95% CI: 
48-59). Among children < 9 years of age, VEadj against laboratory-confirmed 
influenza (55%, 95% CI: 49-61) and hospitalisation (67%, 95% CI: 39-82) was 
higher in those who received a complete dose schedule.
CONCLUSION: In Queensland, the 2022 influenza season started earlier than the 
previous 5 years. VE against influenza notifications varied across age groups. 
VE estimates against influenza-associated hospitalisation were higher than those 
against laboratory-confirmed influenza."

typical health status (OR 2.38; 95%CI 1.60-3.55; screen time ≤2 h/day (OR 1.62; 
95%CI 1.17-2.24); social distancing considered as ""easy"" (OR 1.67; 95%CI 
1.20-2.32), and stimulation of the child by the family (OR 1.93; 95%CI 
1.08-3.45).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the family context can influence 
children's QOL, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and home environment 
reorganization."

"OBJECTIVES: to assess the socio-cognitive factors determining adherence to 
standard precautions by nursing professionals in care practice during the 
COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.
METHODS: an analytical cross-sectional study, carried out with 9,039 nursing 
professionals in Brazil, using an electronic form containing participant 
sociodemographic, training and work variables, and the Brazilian version of the 
Standard Precautions Questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were 
used using the statistical software R.
RESULTS: participants recognize standard precautions as effective measures to 
reduce infections and report intention to perform them. Training regarding 
standard precautions was evidenced as a facilitator of adherence (4.72; SD: 
0.73), and problems related to materials (3.78; SD: 1.45) were a hindrance.
CONCLUSIONS: among the determining factors, facilitating organization presented 
the highest score, followed by intention to perform. Facilitating and hindering 
factor identification makes it possible to develop intervention strategies to 
strengthen patient safety and reduce occupational risks among professionals."

"Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a significant complication in critical 
care patients. COVID-19 (C19)-associated severe respiratory failure is related 
to it, and d-dimer rise predicts a worse outcome. To investigate the association 
between d-dimer and the severity of this respiratory syndrome, we conducted a 
study in C19 intubated patients. A retrospective, single-center observational 
study was conducted with 64 C19 adult intubated patients. Strata of d-dimer 
results between patients was evaluated using survival analysis. Survival was 
higher in mild respiratory distress patients. D-dimer showed poor sensitivity 
and specificity in predicting respiratory failure severity. Risk assessment for 
death showed a higher prevalence of admission d-dimer results (HR 1.335; 95% CI 
0.695-2.564). Our sample confidently represented the medical profile of C19 
severe patients. Sepsis development in C19 is associated with the inflammatory 
storm in respiratory distress syndrome. As the receiver operating curves show, 
the increase in d-dimer results is consistent with inflammation rather than a 
prognostic biomarker. As expected, severe respiratory distress patients 
presented higher mortality. In summary, d-dimer results are not associated with 
the prognosis of C19 respiratory distress syndrome patients."

"This paper describes the results of the study I Want More! The Lives of Sex 
Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic, which is part of the EPIC community 
research program. The study analyzed the effects of the pandemic on the lives of 
cis, trans and travesti sex workers in nine Brazilian states and 11 cities 
throughout 2020 and 2021. This article focuses on the qualitative component of 
the study, which was based on semi-structured, remote and face-to-face 
interviews carried out with 43 sex workers, and its comparison with the 
quantitative component. The effects are analyzed in relation to the Brazilian 
pandemic framework, considering the social, economic and political dimensions of 
the COVID-19 virus. Some of the key themes of the analysis are cases of illness, 
specific social isolation practices, prevention and care management practices, 
individual vaccination and collective vaccination strategies. We also share the 
daily and activist responses drawn up by sex workers in a political agenda that 
opposes the individualistic, familialist, domestic, and neoliberal logic of 
isolation by adopting community care perspectives, which was the only line of 
health action for this work category during the pandemic. Collective actions 
reposition sex work at the interface between public health and human rights and 
take as their principle the ""street knowledge"", from activism, and the workers' 
power of decision over their own bodies."

"During the pandemic, Latin American countries suffered the collapse of their 
health systems. This was caused by the high demand for care of patients infected 
with SARS-CoV-2, which was added to the care of patients with other diseases. 
The significant increase in demand for health services caused medical and 
laboratory supplies to decline rapidly. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated a 
health crisis in several developing countries, mainly caused by insufficient 
systematic policies for integrating scientific knowledge. The current Colombian 
government must formulate a Biotechnological or Biosecurity Sovereignty Law that 
guarantees scientific autonomy, ensuring that Colombia is self-sufficient in 
Science, Technology, and Innovation. Colombian government should also focus on 
establishing and developing pharmaceutical chemical production by acquiring 
active chemical ingredients from other countries. This strategy could reduce the 
production costs and final prices of medicines, as well as generate high-level 
employment and wealth for the country. In this way, the Colombian government 
could prevent shortage of essential medicines and excessive price increases by 
commercial intermediation. In conclusion, the manuscript focuses on the lack of 
biotechnological sovereignty in Colombia. We propose a model of a Latin American 
Science and Technology ecosystem to achieve biotechnological sovereignty via 
state funding of research, strengthening universities, and fostering 
participation among private companies and Ministries of Science, Education, 
Trade, and Health. Scientific autonomy based on innovative processes that 
strengthen biotechnological independence can contribute to the economy by 
generating gross added value, creating high-quality employment, and facilitating 
the appropriation and social dissemination of knowledge, and cost reduction."

"OBJECTIVE: to interpret young nursing professionals' perceptions about the 
relationship between working, employment and health conditions.
METHOD: a qualitative study with an interpretive approach regarding the 
work-related experiences of 15 young nurses, who took part in the research 
through voluntary snowball sampling. The data from the interviews and the focus 
group were analyzed to reach an approximation to the realities inherent to the 
nurses' work life.
RESULTS: the relevant study findings pointed out that work precariousness is a 
characteristic feature in the population group, mainly related to hiring 
modalities and to wages. According to the participants, the psychosocial working 
conditions (which were intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic) were the ones 
that caused the most effects on their mental and physical health.
CONCLUSION: from the young nurses' perspective, this study reports how the 
macro- and micro-structural working conditions and their relationship with 
health are perceived, pointing out the key elements to devise interventions 
focused on life paths that foster decent and healthy work postulates in their 
work environments, as well as actions to prevent injuries or harms to nurses' 
health."

"OBJECTIVE: to describe the epidemic curves and analyze the epidemiological 
profile of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a triple border city.
METHOD: descriptive-quantitative. The population consisted of COVID-19 cases 
that required hospitalization, analyzing variables such as: age, gender, 
race/color, city where they lived, occupation, pregnant woman, institutionalized 
patient and evolution. Descriptive statistical analysis and analysis of variance 
and chi-square tests were used.
RESULTS: four epidemic curves were identified in the studied period. Among 
hospitalized cases, males predominated (55%). Cure was the most frequent outcome 
in curves 1, 2 and 4, but with no statistical difference (p = 0.2916). Curve 3 
showed a higher frequency of deaths (41.70%) in relation to cures (38.77%). The 
mean ages were significantly different between the curves, with curve 4 having 
the lowest mean age.
CONCLUSION: it was concluded that the epidemic curves were influenced by 
different situations; unvaccinated population, easing of restrictive measures, 
reopening of the Brazil-Paraguay border, interruption of control actions, 
crowding of people and circulation of new variants of the disease. Through the 
epidemiological profile of hospitalized patients, it was concluded that being 
male, of mixed race/color, aged between 61 and 85 years, and being deprived of 
freedom were associated with hospitalization and the occurrence of death."

"INTRODUCTION: The United States lacks a national interfacility patient transfer 
coordination system. During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many 
hospitals were overwhelmed and faced difficulties transferring sick patients, 
leading some states and cities to form transfer centers intended to assist 
sending facilities. In this study we aimed to explore clinician experiences with 
newly implemented transfer coordination centers.
METHODS: This mixed-methods study used a brief national survey along with 
in-depth interviews. The American College of Emergency Physicians Emergency 
Medicine Practice Research Network (EMPRN) administered the national survey in 
March 2021. From September-December 2021, semi-structured qualitative interviews 
were conducted with administrators and rural emergency clinicians in Arizona and 
New Mexico, two states that started transfer centers during COVID-19.
RESULTS: Among 141 respondents (of 765, 18.4% response rate) to the national 
EMPRN survey, only 30% reported implementation or expansion of a transfer 
coordination center during COVID-19. Those with new transfer centers reported no 
change in difficulty of patient transfers during COVID-19 while those without 
had increased difficulty. The 17 qualitative interviews expanded upon this, 
revealing four major themes: 1) limited resources for facilitating transfers 
even before COVID-19; 2) increased number of and distance to transfer partners 
during the COVID-19 pandemic; 3) generally positive impacts of transfer centers 
on workflow, and 4) the potential for continued use of centers to facilitate 
transfers.
CONCLUSION: Transfer centers may have offset pandemic-related transfer 
challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinicians who frequently need 
to transfer patients may particularly benefit from ongoing access to such 
transfer coordination services."

"Influenza viruses continually evolve new antigenic variants, through mutations 
in epitopes of their major surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and 
neuraminidase (NA). Antigenic drift potentiates the reinfection of previously 
infected individuals, but the contribution of this process to variability in 
annual epidemics is not well understood. Here, we link influenza A(H3N2) virus 
evolution to regional epidemic dynamics in the United States during 1997-2019. 
We integrate phenotypic measures of HA antigenic drift and sequence-based 
measures of HA and NA fitness to infer antigenic and genetic distances between 
viruses circulating in successive seasons. We estimate the magnitude, severity, 
timing, transmission rate, age-specific patterns, and subtype dominance of each 
regional outbreak and find that genetic distance based on broad sets of epitope 
sites is the strongest evolutionary predictor of A(H3N2) virus epidemiology. 
Increased HA and NA epitope distance between seasons correlates with larger, 
more intense epidemics, higher transmission, greater A(H3N2) subtype dominance, 
and a greater proportion of cases in adults relative to children, consistent 
with increased population susceptibility. Based on random forest models, A(H1N1) 
incidence impacts A(H3N2) epidemics to a greater extent than viral evolution, 
suggesting that subtype interference is a major driver of influenza A virus 
infection ynamics, presumably via heterosubtypic cross-immunity."
"Plain Language Summary: Seasonal influenza (flu) viruses cause outbreaks every 
winter. People infected with influenza typically develop mild respiratory 
symptoms. But flu infections can cause serious illness in young children, older 
adults and people with chronic medical conditions. Infected or vaccinated 
individuals develop some immunity, but the viruses evolve quickly to evade these 
defenses in a process called antigenic drift. As the viruses change, they can 
re-infect previously immune people. Scientists update the flu vaccine yearly to 
keep up with this antigenic drift. The immune system fights flu infections by 
recognizing two proteins, known as antigens, on the virus’s surface, called 
hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). However, mutations in the genes 
encoding these proteins can make them unrecognizable, letting the virus slip 
past the immune system. Scientists would like to know how these changes affect 
the size, severity and timing of annual influenza outbreaks. Perofsky et al. 
show that tracking genetic changes in HA and NA may help improve flu season 
predictions. The experiments compared the severity of 22 flu seasons caused by 
the A(H3N2) subtype in the United States with how much HA and NA had evolved 
since the previous year. The A(H3N2) subtype experiences the fastest rates of 
antigenic drift and causes more cases and deaths than other seasonal flu 
viruses. Genetic changes in HA and NA were a better predictor of A(H3N2) 
outbreak severity than the blood tests for protective antibodies that 
epidemiologists traditionally use to track flu evolution. However, the 
prevalence of another subtype of influenza A circulating in the population, 
called A(H1N1), was an even better predictor of how severe A(H3N2) outbreaks 
would be. Perofsky et al. are the first to show that genetic changes in NA 
contribute to the severity of flu seasons. Previous studies suggested a link 
between genetic changes in HA and flu season severity, and flu vaccines include 
the HA protein to help the body recognize new influenza strains. The results 
suggest that adding the NA protein to flu vaccines may improve their 
effectiveness. In the future, flu forecasters may want to analyze genetic 
changes in both NA and HA to make their outbreak predictions. Tracking how much 
of the A(H1N1) subtype is circulating may also be useful for predicting the 
severity of A(H3N2) outbreaks."

maturation and is the target of Paxlovid, which is currently the 
standard-of-care treatment for COVID-19. There remains a need to identify new 
inhibitors of Mpro as viral resistance to Paxlovid emerges. Here, we report the 
use of native mass spectrometry coupled with 193 nm ultraviolet 
photodissociation (UVPD) and integrated with other biophysical tools to 
structurally characterize Mpro and its interactions with potential covalent 
inhibitors. The overall energy landscape was obtained using variable temperature 
nanoelectrospray ionization (vT-nESI), thus providing quantitative evaluation of 
inhibitor binding on the stability of Mpro. Thermodynamic parameters extracted 
from van't Hoff plots revealed that the dimeric complexes containing each 
inhibitor showed enhanced stability through increased melting temperatures as 
well as overall lower average charge states, giving insight into the basis for 
inhibition mechanisms."

"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), as a respiratory infectious disease, 
poses significant risks of covert transmission and dissemination. The high 
aggregation and close contact among students in Chinese schools exacerbate the 
transmission risk of PTB outbreaks.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the epidemiological characteristics, 
geographic distribution, and spatiotemporal evolution of student PTB in 
Chongqing, Southwest China, aiming to delineate the incidence risks and 
clustering patterns of PTB among students.
METHODS: PTB case data from students monitored and reported in the Tuberculosis 
Information Management System within the China Information System for Disease 
Control and Prevention were used for this study. Descriptive analyses were 
conducted to characterize the epidemiological features of student PTB. Spatial 
trend surface analysis, global and local spatial autocorrelation analyses, and 
disease rate mapping were performed using ArcGIS 10.3. SaTScan 9.6 software was 
used to identify spatiotemporal clusters of PTB cases.
RESULTS: From 2016 to 2022, a total of 9920 student TB cases were reported in 
Chongqing, Southwest China, with an average incidence rate of 24.89/100,000. The 
incidence of student TB showed an initial increase followed by a decline, yet it 
remained relatively high. High school students (age: 13-18 years; 6649/9920, 
67.03%) and college students (age: ≥19 years; 2921/9920, 29.45%) accounted for 
the majority of student PTB cases. Patient identification primarily relied on 
passive detection, with a high proportion of delayed diagnosis and positive 
etiological results. COVID-19 prevention measures have had some impact on 
reducing incidence levels, but the primary factor appears to be the 
implementation of screening measures, which facilitated earlier case detection. 
Global spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated Moran I values of >0 for all 
years except 2018, ranging from 0.1908 to 0.4645 (all P values were <.05), 
suggesting strong positive spatial clustering of student PTB cases across 
Chongqing. Local spatial autocorrelation identified 7 high-high clusters, 13 
low-low clusters, 5 high-low clusters, and 4 low-high clusters. High-high 
clusters were predominantly located in the southeast and northeast parts of 
Chongqing, consistent with spatial trend surface analysis and spatiotemporal 
clustering results. Spatiotemporal scan analysis revealed 4 statistically 
significant spatiotemporal clusters, with the most likely cluster in the 
southeast (relative risk [RR]=2.87, log likelihood ratio [LLR]=574.29, P<.001) 
and a secondary cluster in the northeast (RR=1.99, LLR=234.67, P<.001), 
indicating higher reported student TB cases and elevated risks of epidemic 
spread within these regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Future efforts should comprehensively enhance prevention and 
control measures in high-risk areas of PTB in Chongqing to mitigate the 
incidence risk among students. Additionally, implementing proactive screening 
strategies and enhancing screening measures are crucial for early identification 
of student patients to prevent PTB outbreaks in schools."

"The COVID-19 pandemic has required an expeditious advancement of innovative 
antiviral drugs. In this study, focused compound libraries are synthesized in 
96- well plates utilizing modular click chemistry to rapidly discover potent 
inhibitors targeting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent direct 
biological screening identifies novel 1,2,3-triazole derivatives as robust Mpro 
inhibitors with high anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Notably, C5N17B demonstrates 
sub-micromolar Mpro inhibitory potency (IC50 = 0.12 µM) and excellent antiviral 
activity in Calu-3 cells determined in an immunofluorescence-based antiviral 
assay (EC50 = 0.078 µM, no cytotoxicity: CC50 > 100 µM). C5N17B shows superior 
potency to nirmatrelvir (EC50 = 1.95 µM) and similar efficacy to ensitrelvir 
(EC50 = 0.11 µM). Importantly, this compound displays high antiviral activities 
against several SARS-CoV-2 variants (Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, EC50 = 0.13 - 
0.26 µM) and HCoV-OC43, indicating its broad-spectrum antiviral activity. It is 
worthy that C5N17B retains antiviral activity against nirmatrelvir-resistant 
strains with T21I/E166V and L50F/E166V mutations in Mpro (EC50 = 0.26 and 0.15 
µM, respectively). Furthermore, C5N17B displays favorable pharmacokinetic 
properties. Crystallography studies reveal a unique, non-covalent multi-site 
binding mode. In conclusion, these findings substantiate the potential of C5N17B 
as an up-and-coming drug candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for clinical 
therapy."

"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on the mental health 
of children and adolescents. The literature lacks large-scale research 
evaluating its consequences on teenagers with feeding and eating disorders 
(FED). This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a 
population of patients of developmental age.
METHODS: This single-center observational study compares two historical cohorts 
of children and adolescents diagnosed with FED, with a first consultation before 
(1st March 2018 to 31st October 2019) and during (1st March 2020 to 31st October 
2021) pandemic. Demographic, clinical, nutritional, and treatment variables were 
assessed.
RESULTS: We enrolled 479 patients (F=398, 83.1%), including 205 (F=161, 78.5% 
mean age 14.5±2.5, range 7.9-17.9 years) belonging to the first historical 
cohort and 274 (F=237, 86.5%; 14.4±2.1, range 6.5-17.9) to the second one 
(+33.7%). Increased mean new accesses/month (P=0.042) and a greater percentage 
of females (P=0.042) during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period 
emerged. Physical hyperactivity (P=0.022) and suicidal behaviors (P=0.030) 
increased, while fewer patients required hospitalization (P=0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: An increase in first visits for FED after the COVID-19 pandemic 
emerged, with females being the most affected. Physical hyperactivity and 
self-harming behaviors were intensified, while patients in need of 
hospitalization were reduced. Longitudinal studies are required."

"OBJECTIVE: To assess incidence rates of clinically diagnosed eating disorders 
among Danish youth before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHOD: This study used a population-based time series analysis with 
individual-level data from Danish healthcare registries. Participants included 
all Danish individuals aged 6-24 years from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 
2023. Monthly incident cases of any eating disorder, anorexia nervosa, and 
bulimia nervosa were analyzed using interrupted time-series analysis. We 
estimated the cumulative number of excess cases of incident eating disorder 
diagnoses and risk ratios (RR) associated with the pandemic and post-pandemic 
periods compared with pre-pandemic predictions.
RESULTS: The study population encountered a mean of 1,310,542 individuals during 
the study period. The study included 11,693 individuals diagnosed with an eating 
disorder, median age 17 (IQR 14-20 years). Incident cases increased during the 
pandemic (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.15-1.45) and normalized post-pandemic (RR 1.07, 95% 
CI 0.91-1.25) compared with pre-pandemic predictions. Similar patterns were seen 
for anorexia and bulimia. Increases were significant for ages 13-16 (RR 1.19, 
95% CI 1.02-1.38), 17-19 (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.25-1.83), and 20-24 (RR 1.35, 95% CI 
1.12-1.64). Post-pandemically, a continued increase was observed only for ages 
20-24 (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.02-1.71).
CONCLUSIONS: The study documents a temporary increase in diagnosed eating 
disorders among Danish youths during the COVID-19 pandemic, with rates later 
returning to pre-pandemic levels. These results provide insights into the 
pandemic's impact on adolescents and youths."

"RATIONALE: Practice context is known to influence the deployment of 
competencies. The COVID-19 pandemic created a major disruption in many practice 
contexts. The objective was to understand the lived experience of rehabilitation 
clinicians during a major disruption of their practice context, namely, the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We used a longitudinal phenomenological design. Eligible clinicians 
were occupational therapists (OT), physical therapists (PT), physiotherapy 
technologists (Phys T.), speech-language pathologists (S-LP) and audiologists 
(AUD), working in the same rehabilitation workplace for at least 2 years before 
March 2020 (the pandemic). Clinicians who were reassigned to roles outside the 
field of rehabilitation were excluded. We conducted individual online interviews 
using a guide developed by the team with expertise and knowledge of the 
phenomenon. An interpretative phenomenological analysis was carried out. Results 
were discussed until the research team reached a consensus.
RESULTS: A total of 32 clinicians participated in the study (12 OT, 5 PT, 5 Phys 
T., 7 S-LP, 3 AUD), working with a variety of clienteles and work settings, for 
an average of 11.7 ± 7.6 years in the same practice setting. A wide range of 
emotions (e.g. anger, sadness, guilt, fear, pride) reflected clinicians' 
experience during disruption. Professional expertise was perceived as being 
enhanced by disruption as clinicians stepped out of their comfort zone; this 
encouraged reflective practice and a recognition of the need to be more explicit 
about their decision-making process. Collaboration with colleagues was perceived 
as key for effective coping and deployment of adaptative expertise.
CONCLUSIONS: A disruption in the practice context may have positive effects on 
professional expertise through the mobilization of reflective practice."

"The cGAMP-aluminum nanoparticles (CAN) are engineered as a vaccine 
adjuvant-delivery system to carry mixed RBD (receptor-binding domain) of the 
original severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its 
new variant for developing bivalent pulmonary coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) vaccines (biRBD-CAN). High phosphophilicity/adsorptivity made 
intrapulmonary CAN instantly form the pulmonary ingredient-coated CAN (piCAN) to 
possess biomimetic features enhancing biocompatibility. In vitro biRBD-CAN 
sparked APCs (antigen-presenting cells) to mature and make extra reactive oxygen 
species, engendered lysosome escape effects and enhanced proteasome activities. 
Through activating the intracellular stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and 
nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 
proteins 3 (NALP3) inflammasome pathways to exert synergy between cGAMP and AN, 
biRBD-CAN stimulated APCs to secret cytokines favoring mixed Th1/Th2 
immunoresponses. Mice bearing twice intrapulmonary biRBD-CAN produced high 
levels of mucosal antibodies, the long-lasting systemic antibodies, and potent 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes which efficiently erased cells displaying cognate 
epitopes. Notably, biRBD-CAN existed in mouse lungs and different lymph nodes 
for at least 48 h, unveiling their sustained immunostimulatory activity as the 
main mechanism underlying the long-lasting immunity and memory. Hamsters bearing 
twice intrapulmonary biRBD-CAN developed high resistance to pseudoviral 
challenges performed using different recombinant strains including the ones with 
distinct SARS-CoV-2-spike mutations. Thus, biRBD-CAN as a broad-spectrum 
pulmonary COVID-19 vaccine candidate may provide a tool for controlling the 
emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants."

"BACKGROUND: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has long recognized the 
importance of having a rich complement of home and community-based resources for 
the Veteran population. For Veterans experiencing disability-related 
impairments, home- and community-based services (HCBS) facilitate aging in place 
and alleviate family caregivers' burden. However, even in the enriched VA 
context, HCBS are underutilized. Our objective was to understand unmet needs and 
barriers to accessing HCBS from the perspectives of Veterans' family caregivers.
METHODS: This multi-method study recruited family caregivers of Veterans seen 
within a major VA Health Care System. Eligible caregivers provided care for at 
least 8 h/week in the prior 6 months, to a Veteran with 1+ impairments in 
instrumental activities of daily living. Recruitment was conducted via flyers, 
physician referrals, registries, and chart reviews. Participants completed 1-h 
semi-structured interviews to assess unmet psychosocial needs and barriers to 
accessing VA and non-VA HCBS. Interviews were analyzed using a thematic analysis 
approach.
RESULTS: A total of 23 caregivers (62.9 + 13.5 years; 74% women; 52.2% White; 
26.1% Black; 95.2% pre-9/11) provided 8.4 ± 6.3 h of daily care. Most had 
provided care for more than 1 year; nine had cared for their Veteran for 5+ 
years. The following themes were identified: (1) need for clear, accurate, 
timely information about HCBS; (2) lack of time, amplified by COVID-19 
restrictions; (3) need for respite to manage their own health and other 
caregiving responsibilities; and (4) perceived difference in care needs that can 
strain caregivers' relationship with the care recipient.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to known barriers including lack of timely knowledge, 
service delays, and caregiver stress, Veteran-caregiver disagreements emerged as 
a novel barrier to using HCBS. A multi-pronged approach that addresses these 
barriers may increase timely access to HCBS."

"Knowledge about research participation in care homes is sparse. To explore 
research participation in Scottish care homes, including the potential barriers 
and facilitators, a short survey was distributed to all care homes in Scotland 
in 2014. The survey was repeated in 2022 as care homes emerged from the effects 
of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This article provides a 
comparison of the results of the 2022 survey (45 responses) with those of the 
2014 survey (130 responses); the surveys were completed by care home staff. The 
results indicate that there has been a slight increase in the proportion of care 
homes involved in research in the intervening period but overall, research 
participation has remained low in this sector. In the 2022 survey, the main 
factors identified as influencing a resident's decision to participate in 
research were 'to help others', 'to benefit the resident' and the 'resident's 
desire to participate'. The main obstacles to research participation by staff 
and/or residents were workload pressure and lack of time, which had increased 
significantly since the 2014 survey. The results reinforce the importance of 
ensuring care home staff feel equipped to participate in research."

METHODS: In this prospective study, 100 long COVID patients with respiratory 
dysfunction underwent SDCT and ULDCT chest that were compared in terms of 
objective (signal-to-noise ratio, SNR) and subjective image quality (image 
graininess, sharpness, artifacts, and diagnostic accuracy along with the 
European guidelines on image quality criteria for CT chest), detection of 
imaging patterns of long COVID, CT severity score, and effective radiation dose. 
Additionally, the diagnostic performance of ULDCT was compared among obese 
(BMI≥30 kg/m2) and non-obese (BMI<30 kg/m2) subjects.
RESULTS: The mean age of study participants was 53 ± 12.9 years, and 68% were 
male. The mean SNR was 31.4 ± 5.5 and 11.3 ± 4.6 for SDCT and ULDCT respectively 
(p< 0.0001). Common findings seen on SDCT included ground-glass opacities (GGOs, 
77%), septal thickening/reticulations (67%), atelectatic/parenchymal bands (63%) 
and nodules (26%). ULDCT provided sharp images, with no/minimal graininess, and 
high diagnostic confidence in 81%, 82% and 80% of the cases respectively. The 
sensitivity of ULDCT for various patterns of long COVID was 72.7% (GGOs), 71.6% 
(interlobular septal thickening/reticulations), 100% (consolidation), 81% 
(atelectatic/parenchymal bands) and 76.9% (nodules). ULDCT scans in non-obese 
subjects exhibited a significantly higher sensitivity (88% vs. 60.3%, p < 
0.0001) and diagnostic accuracy (97.7% vs. 84.9%, p < 0.0001) compared to obese 
subjects. ULDCT showed very strong correlation with SDCT in terms of CT severity 
score (r = 0.996, p < 0.0001). The mean effective radiation dose with ULDCT was 
0.25 ± 0.02 mSv with net radiation dose reduction of 94.8% ± 1.7% (p < 0.0001) 
when compared to SDCT (5.5 ± 1.96 mSv).
CONCLUSION: ULDCT scans achieved comparable diagnostic accuracy to SDCT for 
detecting long COVID lung abnormalities in non-obese patients, while 
significantly reducing radiation exposure."

"Since the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several 
autoimmune and subacute thyroiditis (SAT) cases are on the rise all over the 
world. COVID-19 vaccine-associated SAT cases have also been reported. In this 
article, we present our data on 5 vaccine-associated SAT cases. We evaluated the 
type of vaccine received, the time between vaccination and the onset of SAT 
symptoms, laboratory findings, treatments administered, and response to 
treatment. The age of patients ranged from 31 to 43 years old. Three (60 %) 
patients had been diagnosed as SAT after the first dose, and tow (40 %) after 
the second dose. Patients' symptoms appeared approximately 25.2 days (2-44) 
after vaccination. Subacute thyroiditis occurring after COVID-19 vaccination is 
rare, we hope practitioners should be early aware of post-vaccine SAT, that can 
improve clinical evolution and outcome."

"BACKGROUND: Impaired cognitive ability is one of the most frequently reported 
neuropsychiatric symptoms in the post-COVID phase among patients. It is unclear 
whether this condition is related to structural or functional brain changes.
PURPOSE: In this study, we present a multimodal magnetic resonance imaging study 
of 36 post-COVID patients and 36 individually matched controls who had a mild 
form of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) infection 
from March 2020 to February 2022. This study aimed to investigate structural and 
functional brain alterations and their correlation with post-COVID symptoms and 
neurocognitive functions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study protocol comprised an assessment of physical 
fatigue [Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)], mental fatigue (Mental Fatigue Scale 
(MFS)], depression [Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)], anxiety 
[Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)], post-COVID Symptoms Severity 
Score, and neurocognitive status [Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of 
Neuropsychological Status Update (RBANS)]. The magnetic resonance imaging 
protocol included morphological sequences, arterial spin labeling (ASL) and 
dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) perfusion, diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI), and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
sequences. Using these protocols, the assessments of macrostructural 
abnormalities, perfusion, gray matter density, white matter integrity, and brain 
connectivity were performed.
RESULTS: Post-COVID patients had higher levels of physical fatigue, mental 
fatigue, depression, and anxiety than controls and showed cognitive impairment 
in all the RBANS domains except in Visuospatial/Construction. The subjective 
mental fatigue correlated with objective impaired cognitive ability in the RBANS 
test, particularly in the Attention domain. There were no differences between 
patients and controls regarding macrostructural abnormalities, regional volumes, 
regional perfusion metrics, gray matter density, or DTI parameters. We observed 
a significant positive correlation between RBANS Total Scale Index score and 
gray matter volume in the right superior/middle-temporal gyrus (p < 0.05) and a 
significant negative correlation between the white matter integrity and 
post-COVID symptoms (p < 0.05) in the same area. The connectivity differences 
were observed between patients and controls in a few regions, including the 
right middle frontal gyrus, an important area of convergence of the dorsal and 
ventral attention networks. We also noted a positive correlation between 
post-COVID symptoms and increased connectivity in the right temporoparietal 
junction, which is part of the ventral attention system.
CONCLUSION: In non-hospitalized subjects with post-COVID, we did not find any 
structural brain changes or changes in perfusion, compared to controls. However, 
we noted differences in connectivity within an important area for attention 
processes, which may be associated with post-COVID brain fog."

"Even though death due to COVID-19 is no longer a public health emergency, less 
virulent but highly transmissible forms of SARS-CoV-2 continue to spread in many 
countries leading to outbreaks and rise in hospitalizations in the affected 
regions. Lessons learned during the pandemic must be put into action to protect 
the world's population from another catastrophe like COVID-19. Novel approaches 
that were developed for tracking the spread of SARS-CoV-2 included analysis of 
wastewater, air samples, and various environmental surfaces. We conducted a 
study in Kuwait during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic to examine if SARS-CoV-2 
could be detected in swabs taken from frequently touched environmental surfaces. 
We selected 12 Cooperative Society Stores-two from each governorate of 
Kuwait-for collection of surface samples. The Cooperative Society Stores are 
widely distributed across the whole country and cater to daily household needs 
including groceries and other essential items. These stores operated even during 
the ""lockdown"" imposed at the height of the pandemic. We collected swabs from 
high-touch surfaces including the handles of the shopping carts and freezers, 
the elevators, the keypads of the point-of-service terminals of cash counters, 
and the automated teller machines. All the surfaces tested showed a variable 
presence of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR, showing the 
validity of the proof-of-concept study. Monitoring of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 
by surface sampling thus offers a cheap but effective means of environmental 
surveillance for coronaviruses. We therefore strongly recommend the addition of 
surface environmental sampling as a strategy for pandemic preparedness 
everywhere."

"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the direct effects of exposure to media 
information about infection-preventing behavior and its indirect effects via 
interpersonal communication at two time points during the pandemic.
METHODS: In August 2020 and August 2021, a web-based survey of Japanese people 
under a declared state of emergency was conducted. We collected sociodemographic 
data and data on seven types of exposure to media information, three types of 
exposure to interpersonal communication, and six types of infection-preventing 
behavior.
RESULTS: A total of 784 participants completed both surveys. Exposure to 
information in the mass media decreased over the year, while interpersonal 
communication about COVID-19-related topics increased. The direct effect of 
exposure to information in the media about preventive behaviors was 
statistically significant in the pandemic's early stages, but this was no longer 
true after 1 year. The indirect effect via interpersonal communication was 
statistically significant at both time points.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the influence of media information on 
infection-preventing behavior during the pandemic was maintained over time as an 
indirect effect via interpersonal communication. For risk communication media 
strategies during pandemics, adopting strategies to generate interpersonal 
communication will have a sustained effect on preventive behavior."

"INTRODUCTION: Following harmonization efforts by the Belgian National Reference 
Center for SARS-CoV-2, semi-quantitative PCR test (SQ-PCR) results, used as a 
proxy for viral load, were routinely collected after performing RT-qPCR tests.
METHODS: We investigated both the personal characteristics associated with 
SQ-PCR results and the transmission dynamics involving these results. We used 
person-level laboratory test data and contact tracing data collected in Belgium 
from March 2021 to February 2022. Personal characteristics (age, sex, 
vaccination, and laboratory-confirmed prior infection) and disease stage by date 
of symptom onset were analyzed in relation to SQ-PCR results using logistic 
regression. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against a high viral load (≥107 
copies/mL) was estimated from the adjusted probabilities. Contact tracing 
involves the mandatory testing of high-risk exposure contacts (HREC) after 
contact with an index case. Odds ratios for test positivity and high viral load 
in HREC were calculated based on the SQ-PCR result of the index case using 
logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, immunity status (vaccination, 
laboratory-confirmed prior infection), variant (Alpha, Delta, Omicron), calendar 
time, and contact tracing covariates.
RESULTS: We included 909,157 SQ-PCR results of COVID-19 cases, 379,640 PCR 
results from index cases, and 72,052 SQ-PCR results of HREC. High viral load was 
observed more frequently among recent cases, symptomatic cases, cases over 
25 years of age, and those not recently vaccinated (>90 days). The vaccine 
effectiveness (VE) of the primary schedule in the first 30 days after 
vaccination was estimated at 47.3% (95%CI 40.8-53.2) during the Delta variant 
period. A high viral load in index cases was associated with an increased test 
positivity in HREC (OR 2.7, 95%CI 2.62-2.79) and, among those testing positive, 
an increased likelihood of a high viral load (OR 2.84, 95%CI 2.53-3.19)."

"BACKGROUND: The number of people undergoing voluntary HIV testing has abruptly 
decreased since 2020. The geographical heterogeneity of HIV infection and the 
impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis of HIV at regional level are important to 
understand. This study aimed to estimate the HIV incidence by geographical 
region and understand how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced diagnosis of HIV.
METHODS: We used an extended back-calculation method to reconstruct the 
epidemiological dynamics of HIV/AIDS by geographical region. We used eight 
regions: Tokyo, the capital of Japan, Hokkaido plus Tohoku, Kanto plus 
Koshinetsu (excluding Tokyo), Hokuriku, Tokai, Kinki, Chugoku plus Shikoku, and 
Kyushu plus Okinawa. Four different epidemiological measurements were evaluated: 
(i) estimated HIV incidence, (ii) estimated rate of diagnosis, (iii) number of 
undiagnosed HIV infections, and (iv) proportion of HIV infections that had been 
diagnosed.
RESULTS: The incidence of HIV/AIDS during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 
2022 increased in all regions except Kanto/Koshinetsu (51.3 cases/year), Tokyo 
(183.9 cases/year), Hokuriku (1.0 cases/year), and Tokai (43.1 cases/year). The 
proportion of HIV infections that had been diagnosed only exceeded 90% in Tokyo 
(91.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 90.6, 93.3), Kanto/Koshinetsu (91.0%, 95% 
CI: 87.3, 97.8), and Kinki (92.5%, 95% CI: 90.4, 95.9). The proportion of 
infections that had been diagnosed was estimated at 83.3% (95% CI: 75.1, 98.7) 
in Chugoku/Shikoku and 80.5% (95% CI: 73.9, 91.0) in Kyusyu/Okinawa.
CONCLUSIONS: In urban regions with major metropolitan cities, including Tokyo, 
Kinki, and Kanto/Koshinetsu, the number of undiagnosed HIV infections is 
substantial. However, the proportion of undiagnosed infections was estimated to 
be smaller than in other regions. The diagnosed proportion was the lowest in 
Kyusyu/Okinawa (80.5%), followed by Chugoku/Shikoku and Hokkaido/Tohoku. The 
level of diagnosis in those regional prefectures may have been more influenced 
and damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic than in urban settings."

"We investigated the effects of 35 inflammatory cytokines on respiratory 
outcomes, including COVID-19, asthma (atopic and non-atopic), chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary function indices, using 
Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses. The emerging associations 
were further explored using observational analyses in the UK Biobank. We found 
an inverse association between genetically predicted macrophage colony 
stimulating factor (MCSF), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM), 
and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 with risk of COVID-19 outcomes. 
sICAM was positively associated with atopic asthma risk, whereas tumor necrosis 
factor-alfa showed an inverse association. A positive association was shown 
between interleukin-18 and COPD risk (replicated in observational analysis), 
whereas an inverse association was shown for interleukin-1 receptor antagonist 
(IL-1ra). IL-1ra and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 were positively associated 
with lung function indices, whereas inverse associations were shown for MCSF and 
interleukin-18 (replicated in observational analysis). Our results point to 
these cytokines as potential pharmacological targets for respiratory traits."

"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a significant 
global health challenge, with approximately 39 million people living with HIV 
worldwide as of 2022. Despite progress in antiretroviral therapy, achieving the 
UNAIDS ""95-95-95"" target to end the HIV epidemic by 2025 faces challenges, 
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The pursuit of an HIV vaccine is crucial, 
offering durable immunity and the potential to end the epidemic. Challenges in 
vaccine development include the lack of known immune correlates, suitable animal 
models, and HIV's high mutation rate. This study aims to explore the current 
state of HIV vaccine development, focusing on the challenges and innovative 
approaches being investigated.
METHODS: In writing this review, we conducted a search of medical databases such 
as PubMed, ResearchGate, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus. The 
exploration of messenger ribonucleic acid vaccines, which have proven successful 
in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, presents a promising avenue for HIV vaccine 
development. Understanding HIV-1's ability to infiltrate various bodily 
compartments, establish reservoirs, and manipulate immune responses is critical. 
Robust cytotoxic T lymphocytes and broadly neutralizing antibodies are 
identified as key components, though their production faces challenges. 
Innovative approaches, including computational learning and advanced drug 
delivery systems, are being investigated to effectively activate the immune 
system.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Discrepancies between animal models and human responses 
have hindered the progress of vaccine development. Despite these challenges, 
ongoing research is focused on overcoming these obstacles through advanced 
methodologies and technologies. Addressing the challenges in HIV vaccine 
development is paramount to realizing an effective HIV-1 vaccine and achieving 
the goal of ending the epidemic. The integration of innovative approaches and a 
deeper understanding of HIV-1's mechanisms are essential steps toward this 
transformative breakthrough."

"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors (ACE2R) are requisite to enter the 
host cells for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
ACE2R is constitutive and functions as a type I transmembrane 
metallo-carboxypeptidase in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). On thyroid 
follicular cells, ACE2R allows SARS-CoV-2 to invade the thyroid gland, impose 
cytopathic effects and produce endocrine abnormalities, including stiff back, 
neck pain, muscle ache, lethargy, and enlarged, inflamed thyroid gland in 
COVID-19 patients. Further damage is perpetuated by the sudden bursts of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is suggestive of a life-threatening syndrome 
known as a ""cytokine storm"". IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α are identified as the 
key orchestrators of the cytokine storm. These inflammatory mediators upregulate 
transcriptional turnover of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), Janus kinase/signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), and mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK), paving the pathway for cytokine storm-induced thyroid 
dysfunctions including euthyroid sick syndrome, autoimmune thyroid diseases, and 
thyrotoxicosis in COVID-19 patients. Targeted therapies with corticosteroids 
(dexamethasone), JAK inhibitor (baricitinib), nucleotide analogue (remdesivir) 
and N-acetyl-cysteine have demonstrated effectiveness in terms of attenuating 
the severity and frequency of cytokine storm-induced thyroid dysfunctions, 
morbidity and mortality in severe COVID-19 patients. Here, we review the 
pathogenesis of cytokine storms and the mechanisms and pathways that establish 
the connection between thyroid disorder and COVID-19. Moreover, cross-talk 
interactions of signalling pathways and therapeutic strategies to address 
COVID-19-associated thyroid diseases are also discussed herein."

"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare delivery and increased 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This study assesses whether 
cardiovascular mortality rates in the US have recovered post-pandemic and 
examines the equity of this recovery across different populations.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the CDC WONDER database, covering US residents' 
mortality from 2018-2023. We focused on cardiovascular diseases, categorized by 
ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure (HF), hypertensive diseases (HTN), 
and cerebrovascular disease. Age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated for 
three periods: pre-COVID (2018-2019), during COVID (2020-2021), and post-COVID 
(2022-2023), stratified by demographic and geographic variables.
RESULTS: Cardiovascular age-adjusted mortality rates increased by 5.9% during 
the pandemic but decreased by 3.4% post-pandemic, resulting in a net increase of 
2.4% compared to pre-COVID levels. When compared to pre COVID age-adjusted 
mortality rates, post COVID IHD mortality age-adjusted mortality rates decreased 
by 5.0%, while cerebrovascular and HTN age-adjusted mortality rates increased by 
5.9% and 28.5%, respectively. Men and younger populations showed higher 
increases in cardiovascular Age-adjusted mortality rates. Geographic disparities 
were notable, with significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality in the 
Northeast and increases in states like Arizona and Oregon.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a surge in cardiovascular mortality, 
with partial recovery post-pandemic. Significant differences in mortality 
changes highlight the need for targeted healthcare interventions to address 
inequities across demographic and geographic groups."

"BACKGROUND: Data are limited on the protective role of the Omicron BA bivalent 
vaccine, previous infection, and their induced neutralizing antibodies against 
Omicron XBB.1.16 and EG.5.1 infection.
METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control analysis among tertiary hospital 
staff in Tokyo who had received ≥3 doses of COVID-19 vaccines and donated blood 
samples in June 2023 (1 month before the Omicron XBB.1.16 and EG.5.1 wave). We 
identified 206 symptomatic cases between June and September 2023 and selected 
their controls with 1:1 propensity score matching. We examined the association 
of vaccination, previous infection, and preinfection live virus neutralizing 
antibody titers against Omicron XBB.1.16 and EG.5.1 with the risk of COVID-19 
infection.
RESULTS: Previous infection during the Omicron BA- or XBB-dominant phase was 
associated with a significantly lower infection risk during the XBB.1.16 and 
EG.5.1-dominant phase than infection-naive status, with 70% and 100% protection, 
respectively, whereas Omicron BA bivalent vaccination showed no association. 
Preinfection neutralizing titers against XBB.1.16 and EG.5.1 were 39% (95% CI, 
8%-60%) and 28% (95% CI, 8%-44%) lower in cases than matched controls. 
Neutralizing activity against XBB.1.16 and EG.5.1 was somewhat detectable in the 
sera of individuals with previous infection but barely detectable in those who 
were infection naive and received the Omicron bivalent vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: In the era when the Omicron XBB vaccine was unavailable, the 
Omicron BA bivalent vaccine did not confer the neutralizing activity and 
protection against Omicron XBB.1.16 and EG.5.1 symptomatic infection. The 
previous infection afforded neutralizing titers and protection against 
symptomatic infection with these variants."

"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused over 
600 million confirmed infections and more than 6.8 million deaths worldwide, 
with ongoing implications for human health. COVID-19 has been extensively 
documented to have extrapulmonary manifestations due to the widespread 
expression of necessary ACE2 receptors in the human body. Nevertheless, the 
association between COVID-19 and cancer risk remains inadequately explored. This 
study employs Mendelian randomization (MR) methods to examine the causal 
relationship between genetic variations associated with COVID-19 and the risk of 
developing cancer. The findings indicate that COVID-19 has negligible impact on 
most cancer risks. Interestingly, a higher COVID-19 impact is associated with a 
decreased risk of thyroid cancer. In summary, our findings demonstrate a genetic 
correlation between COVID-19 and thyroid cancer, contributing to our 
understanding of the interplay between COVID-19 and cancer risk."

"BACKGROUND: The incidence of hepatic abnormalities has been notably higher 
following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, attributed to the 
virus's entry into cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) surface 
expression. The gastrointestinal tract's significant ACE2 expression, alongside 
a lesser degree in the biliary epithelium, has been implicated in 
gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine whether specific 
ultrasonographic findings in the liver correlate with acute increases in liver 
function tests (LFTs) among hospitalized patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on hospitalized COVID-19 
patients at Hazem Mebaireek General Hospital in Qatar, from March 1, 2020, to 
June 30, 2020. The study focused on patients who experienced acute increases in 
LFTs, excluding those with chronic liver disease. Ultrasound imaging and patient 
records were reviewed to gather data.
RESULTS: Out of 223 ultrasound studies of COVID-19 patients, 158 met the 
inclusion criteria. The majority were male, with a mean age of 47.76 ± 13.76 
years. Ultrasound results showed 43.7% normal liver parenchyma, while 56.3% 
exhibited nonspecific abnormalities such as diffuse liver hyperechogenicity 
(39.2%), enlargement with diffuse hyperechogenicity (12.7%), and other findings 
(4.4%). The biliary tree was predominantly normal (96.2%), with 3.8% showing 
abnormalities, including intrahepatic (2.5%) and extrahepatic (1.3%) dilatation. 
Gallbladder evaluations were normal in 60.1% of cases, with 39.9% showing 
abnormalities like stones (6.3%), stones with sludge (13.3%), polyps (6.3%), 
wall thickening (1.9%), and other conditions (12%). A significant correlation 
was found between abnormal liver parenchyma findings and elevated levels of 
bilirubin (total and direct) and alkaline phosphatase, with p-values < 0.05. 
Only aspartate aminotransferase levels showed a significant correlation with 
biliary tree abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: The most common ultrasonographic finding associated with acute 
increases in LFTs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was diffuse liver 
hyperechogenicity, with or without enlargement. These findings suggest a 
nonspecific yet significant association with liver function anomalies in the 
context of COVID-19."

"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to global public 
health, necessitating the rapid development and distribution of vaccines. 
Despite the availability of effective vaccines, vaccination uptake remains 
varied across different regions and populations. This study aims to investigate 
the factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination uptake in South Indian districts, 
with a focus on understanding public perceptions. Utilizing a cross-sectional 
survey methodology, data were collected from a representative sample of 
residents in selected South Indian districts. The survey explored a range of 
variables including demographic characteristics, knowledge and awareness about 
COVID-19 vaccines, perceived risks and benefits, trust in healthcare systems, 
and sources of vaccine-related information. The preliminary analysis indicates 
that vaccine uptake is significantly influenced by factors such as age, 
educational level, and socioeconomic status. High levels of vaccine hesitancy 
were associated with misinformation, concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy, 
and distrust in government and healthcare authorities. Conversely, individuals 
with higher education levels and those who received accurate information from 
trusted sources showed a greater willingness to get vaccinated. Social and 
cultural beliefs also played a crucial role in influencing vaccination 
attitudes, stressing the need for the importance of culturally sensitive health 
communication strategies. The study investigates a range of factors, including 
demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education level, and 
socio-economic status, as well as psychological and social determinants like the 
perceived risk of COVID-19, trust in vaccines, and the influence of 
misinformation. This study underscores the need for targeted public health 
interventions to address vaccine hesitancy and improve vaccination rates in 
South India. By identifying the key factors influencing vaccination decisions, 
policymakers and healthcare providers can develop more effective communication 
and outreach programs tailored to the unique needs and concerns of the 
population. Enhanced efforts in education, transparency, and community 
engagement are essential to fostering greater public trust and achieving higher 
vaccination coverage."

"BACKGROUND: Several Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been developed in recent 
years. These agents are widely applicable in clinical practice as an alternative 
treatment for immune-mediated diseases. While the safety and efficacy profile of 
these drugs has been evaluated in several randomized clinical trials and 
studies, very few authors have assessed safety and effectiveness under the 
real-world conditions of daily clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the effectiveness and safety of JAK 
inhibitors in daily clinical practice for the treatment of immune-mediated 
rheumatic diseases in a university hospital.
METHODS: We performed a single-center observational, descriptive, retrospective 
study of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), 
and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) receiving active treatment with JAK inhibitors 
between March 2022 and February 2023. We recorded study variables from the 
clinical history for subsequent analysis using STATA 12.0 (StataCorp LLC, 
College Station, TX). A 95% confidence interval was applied.
RESULTS: The final analysis was performed on 64 patients (upadacitinib: 27, 
baricitinib: 16, tofacitinib: 13, filgotinib: eight), with a mean age of 
55.69±10.78 years (60.94% females). The distribution by disease was as follows: 
RA, 44 (70.31%); SpA, 11 (17.18%); and PsA, eight (12.5%). A significant 
improvement was observed in all groups at six to 12 months, as follows: RA, 
remission in 48.89% and low activity in 26.67%; SpA, remission in 9.09% and low 
activity in 54.54%; and PsA, low activity in 87.5%. The factors most associated 
with poor response to treatment were activity before initiation of treatment and 
previous failure of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). 
Adverse effects and complications were detected in 26.56% (SARS-CoV-2, one case; 
basal cell carcinoma, one case; and herpes zoster, two cases). There were no 
reports of cardiovascular or thromboembolic events, opportunistic infection, or 
tuberculosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our real-world data show that treatment with JAK inhibitors leads 
to a high rate of remission/low activity that remains unchanged at six to 12 
months in RA, SpA, and PsA. The predictors of a poor response to JAK inhibitors 
in our study population were the level of activity before initiation of 
treatment and previous failure of bDMARDs. No cardiovascular or thromboembolic 
events were reported. Of note, we did record one case of severe infection, one 
case of basal cell carcinoma, and two cases of herpes zoster."

"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel, primarily 
respiratory, coronavirus that became a pandemic when it spread to over 210 
countries and led to the death of over six million people. There is no 
definitive treatment for COVID-19, but vaccines have been developed that can 
help prevent severe illness and death. Studies have investigated the effect of 
vaccination on disease severity and outcome, and the findings indicate that 
vaccination is linked to a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization, 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and disease mortality. However, there is a 
scarcity of evidence in Africa in general, and no similar study has been 
conducted in Ethiopia yet. Therefore, the study aimed to assess the effect of 
vaccination on COVID-19 disease severity and the need for ICU admission among 
hospitalized patients at a private specialty clinic in Ethiopia. Methods A 
retrospective cohort study was conducted among 126 patients with COVID-19, 41 
vaccinated and 85 unvaccinated, who were hospitalized between September 2021 and 
May 2022. Data were summarized using frequency (percentage) and median 
(interquartile range (IQR)). To compare the characteristics of the two groups, 
Chi-square/Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests at p-values of ≤ 0.05 were 
used. To identify the effect of vaccination on COVID-19 disease severity, a 
marginal structural model (MSM) with an inverse probability weighting (IPW) 
approach using a robust Poisson regression model was fitted. Adjusted relative 
risk (ARR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for ARR were used for interpreting 
the result. Results The cohort included groups that were comparable in terms of 
their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. More than half of the 
participants were older than 60 years (n = 66, 52.4%), were males (n = 71, 
56.3%), and had one or more comorbid illnesses (n = 66, 52.4%). At admission, 85 
(67.5%) had severe disease, and 11 (8.7%) progressed after hospitalization and 
required ICU admission, of which three unvaccinated cases died. From the final 
model, vaccination was found to be associated with a 62% decreased risk of 
developing severe COVID-19 disease if infected, compared to not getting 
vaccinated (ARR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.23-0.65, p < 0.0001). Conclusions The study's 
findings support previous reports that vaccinated people are less likely to 
develop severe COVID-19 disease if later infected with the virus, emphasizing 
the importance of continuing efforts to promote COVID-19 vaccination not only to 
safeguard individuals but also to confer community-level immunity."

"As a key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a validated receptor for SARS-CoV-2, linking RAS to COVID-19. 
Functional ACE1/ACE2 gene polymorphisms likely cause an imbalance in the 
ACE1/ACE2 ratio, triggering RAS imbalance and may contribute to COVID-19 
complications. This study aimed to investigate four single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) of ACE1 and ACE2 genes, three for ACE1 (rs4343, rs4342, 
rs4341) and one for ACE2 (rs2285666), in patients with COVID-19 among the 
Palestinian population. A total of 130 blood samples were collected, including 
50 negative controls without COVID-19 infection, 50 cases with COVID-19 
infection but not hospitalized, and 30 patients with severe COVID-19 infection 
hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Fragments of the ACE1 and ACE2 genes, 
including the targeted SNPs, were amplified using multiplex PCR and subsequently 
genotyped by next-generation sequencing with specific virtual probes. Our 
results revealed that ACE2 rs2285666 GG genotype carriers were more prevalent in 
COVID-19 patients compared to the control group (P=0.049), while no statistical 
differences were observed in the distribution of ACE1 (rs4343, rs4342, rs4341) 
variants between COVID-19 patients and the control group. GA carriers of ACE2, 
rs2285666, among cases and ICU groups were at lower risk of getting COVID-19 
infection (P=0.002 and P=0.013, respectively), and they were unlikely to develop 
fatigue (P=0.043), headache (P=0.007), loss of smell (P=0.028), and dyspnea 
(P=0.005). Age and comorbidities such as hypertension and coronary artery 
disease (CAD) were independent risk factors for COVID-19 disease. Symptoms of 
COVID-19 patients such as fatigue, headaches, runny noses, and loss of smell 
were significantly higher in non-hospitalized cases of COVID-19, while dyspnea 
was more frequent in the ICU patients. In conclusion, these findings indicate 
that the ACE2 rs2285666 GG genotype is associated with an increased risk of 
COVID-19 infection. This association suggests a potential genetic predisposition 
linked to the ACE2 gene, which may influence the susceptibility and severity of 
the disease."

"PROBLEM: At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 
reliable, globally applicable recommendations for safe and continuous school 
operations were lacking.
APPROACH: In October 2020, the German Association of Scientific Medical 
Societies' task force for COVID-19 guidelines and public health researchers at 
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München initiated the rapid development of a 
living evidence- and consensus-based guideline to reduce severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission in schools. To facilitate 
transparent, structured and comprehensive decision-making with a 
whole-of-society perspective, they applied the WHO-INTEGRATE 
evidence-to-decision framework. This framework supported a broad, multisectoral 
composition of the guideline panel. The panel used newly synthesized evidence on 
nine school measures. Participating medical societies or the guideline 
secretariat completed evidence-to-decision tables. They also drafted 
recommendations for the guideline panel, who discussed and revised them during 
moderated consensus conferences.
LOCAL SETTING: In Germany, each state is responsible for organizing schooling. 
The German Association of Scientific Medical Societies coordinates development 
of evidence- and consensus-based guidelines.
RELEVANT CHANGES: The first version of the guideline was published in February 
2021, and the guideline dissemination created much media attention. Of the 16 
state education ministries, almost all knew about the guideline, nine recognized 
it as a relevant source of information and five used it to check existing 
directives.
LESSONS LEARNT: The WHO-INTEGRATE framework facilitated a comprehensive 
assessment of school measures from the start of guideline development, 
considering the broad societal impact of the measures. Using the framework in 
rapid mode was feasible, but it fell short of its potential."

APPROCHE: En octobre 2020, le groupe de travail de l'Association allemande des 
sociétés scientifiques et médicales chargé d'émettre des lignes directrices sur 
la COVID-19, en collaboration avec des chercheurs en santé publique de 
l'Université Louis-et-Maximilien de Munich, a lancé le développement rapide

et exhaustif adoptant la perspective de la société dans son ensemble, il a 
appliqué le cadre WHO-INTEGRATE, un outil privilégiant une prise de décision 
fondée sur des données probantes. Ce cadre a permis de composer un vaste panel 
multisectoriel qui, à la lumière d'une synthèse récente d'éléments factuels, a 
examiné neuf mesures scolaires. De leur côté, les sociétés médicales 
participantes ou le Secrétariat des directives ont complété des tableaux de 
prises de décision fondées sur des données probantes. Ils ont également formulé 
des recommandations à l'attention du panel, qui en a discuté et les a révisées 
lors de conférences de concertation modérées.
ENVIRONNEMENT LOCAL: En Allemagne, l'éducation relève de la responsabilité des 
États fédérés. C'est l'Association allemande des sociétés scientifiques et 
médicales qui coordonne l'élaboration de lignes directrices fondées sur le

"PROBLEM: The Malaita and Western provinces in Solomon Islands had low routine 
immunization coverage due to disruptions in health services caused by the 
coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in early 2022.
APPROACH: The country introduced the World Health Organization (WHO) Reaching 
Every District (RED) approach in 2002. Between July and September 2022, we 
strengthened supportive supervision, monitoring and use of data for 
decision-making, especially for microplanning and re-establishing outreach to 
prioritized areas. Health workers were supported to identify key concerns and 
develop strategies to improve performance. Monthly updates of reported 
immunization coverage, reporting completeness and fieldwork findings were widely 
disseminated.
LOCAL SETTING: Solomon Islands' population is 748 606 people, of whom 165 345 
reside in Malaita and 105 367 in Western Province.
RELEVANT CHANGES: In Malaita Province, reported coverage of third dose of 
pentavalent vaccine and first dose of measles-rubella vaccine increased from 40% 
(757/1892) of eligible children to 121% (1144/946) and from 30% (568/1892) to 
159% (1504/946), respectively; and in Western Province reported coverage 
increased from 38% (443/1165) to 191% (1113/583) and from 44% (513/1165) to 149% 
(868/583), respectively. Reported coverage for the remaining provinces increased 
from 64% (3380/5282) to 88% (2325/2641) and from 59% (3116/5282) to 137% 
(3619/2641), respectively. These findings led the programme on immunization to 
re-expand the WHO RED approach nationwide.
LESSONS LEARNT: Supportive supervision, systematic monitoring and use of data 
for decision-making helped restoring reported immunization coverage in two 
low-coverage provinces. However, sustaining these results at a national level is 
necessary. The WHO RED approach remains relevant, even during a pandemic."

"Publisher: ПРОБЛЕМА: В Западной провинции и провинции Малаита на Соломоновых 
Островах в начале 2022 года наблюдался низкий уровень охвата плановыми 
прививками из-за перебоев в работе медицинских служб, вызванных пандемией 
коронавирусной инфекции 2019 года.
ПОДХОД: В 2002 году в стране была применена стратегия ВОЗ «Охватить каждый 
район» (Reaching Every District, RED). В период с июля по сентябрь 2022 года был 
усилен поддерживающий контроль, мониторинг и использование данных для принятия 
решений. В частности, это касается микропланирования и возобновления работы с 
приоритетными районами. Медицинские работники получили поддержку в определении 
основных проблем и разработке стратегий по улучшению работы. Широко 
распространялись ежемесячные обновленные данные об охвате населения прививками, 
полноте отчетности и результатах работы на выездах.
МЕСТНЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ: Население Соломоновых Островов составляет 748 606 человек, из 
которых 165 345 проживают на острове Малаита и 105 367 – в Западной провинции.
ОСУЩЕСТВЛЕННЫЕ ПЕРЕМЕНЫ: В провинции Малаита охват третьей дозой 
пятикомпонентной вакцины и первой дозой вакцины против кори и краснухи 
увеличился с 40% (757/1892) детей, имеющих право на прививку, до 121% (1144/946) 
и с 30% (568/1892) до 159% (1504/946) соответственно. В Западной провинции охват 
увеличился с 38% (443/1165) до 191% (1113/583) и с 44% (513/1165) до 
149% (868/583) соответственно. Охват остальных провинций увеличился 
с 64% (3380/5282) до 88% (2325/2641) и с 59% (3116/5282) до 137% (3619/2641) 
соответственно. Сделанные выводы послужили основанием для программы охвата 
прививками вновь распространить подход ВОЗ RED на всю страну.
ВЫВОДЫ: Поддерживающий контроль, систематический мониторинг и использование 
данных для принятия решений способствовали восстановлению охвата прививками в 
двух провинциях с низким уровнем охвата. Однако необходимо закрепить эти 
результаты на национальном уровне. Стратегия ВОЗ RED остается актуальной даже во 
время пандемии."

"The normative role of the World Health Organization (WHO) involves creating 
evidence-based, principled guidelines to guide its Member States in making 
well-informed public health decisions. While these guidelines often need to be 
adapted to ensure contextual relevance, foster better implementation and 
adherence, adapting existing guidelines is more efficient than creating new 
ones. Here we describe the adaptation of the WHO coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) living guideline on pharmacological interventions for the Caribbean 
using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation 
(GRADE)-ADOLOPMENT method. The Caribbean Public Health Agency and the Pan 
American Health Organization led the effort, assembling a diverse panel of 16 
experts from seven Caribbean countries and territories. The adaptation process, 
involving 15 steps, was guided by an experienced methodologist and included 
selecting relevant clinical questions and prioritizing them based on regional 
needs. The panel evaluated the latest WHO guidelines and integrated additional 
local data. They adjusted the direction and strength of several recommendations 
to better fit the Caribbean context, considering local values and preferences, 
resources, accessibility, feasibility and impact on health equity. Ultimately, 
we changed the direction of two recommendations and the strength of five, 
tailoring them to regional realities. This effort highlights the importance of 
adapting global guidelines to local settings, improving their applicability and 
effectiveness. The adaptation process also serves as a valuable opportunity for 
skill transfer and capacity-building in guideline development. Continued 
research is needed to assess the impact of these adaptations on health-care 
outcomes in the Caribbean."

"INTRODUCTION: In January 2020, WHO declared the 2019 Coronavirus Disease 
(COVID-19) a pandemic. Though COVID-19 vaccines are recommended, ongoing 
surveillance is crucial due to potential unforeseen events. Evaluation of 
long-term effectiveness and safety and addressing emerging variants are vital. 
This study integrates systematic reviews to assess COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, 
immunogenicity, and safety comprehensively.
METHODS: This study was an umbrella review study on the feasibility and 
effectiveness of vaccines for COVID-19. We conducted a comprehensive search in 
PubMed, Web of Sciences, and Scopus, using MeSH terms and keywords related to 
COVID-19 vaccines. Inclusion criteria comprised peer-reviewed systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses in English, focusing on feasibility and effectiveness. 
Exclusion criteria targeted non-systematic reviews exclusively on vaccine safety 
and duplicates. Two independent reviewers screened and resolved discrepancies. 
Data extraction included key details. Methodological quality was assessed using 
the ROBIS tool. Data synthesis involves narrative and, if applicable, 
quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis). Reporting followed PRISMA guidelines.
RESULTS: A total of 32 systematic reviews were included in the study, of which 
20 also conducted a meta-analysis. The studies investigated in the included 
reviews ranged from 7 to 74. The included articles were conducted in various 
countries around the globe. The findings indicated that COVID-19 vaccines are 
generally safe and effective for individuals with various medical conditions. 
The overall risk of bias for the included studies was assessed as low risk.
CONCLUSION: The study outcomes indicated that mRNA vaccines exhibit a higher 
incidence of adverse events but demonstrate greater efficacy. Conversely, 
inactivated and protein subunit vaccines are safer but exhibit lower efficiency. 
Moreover, the vaccine is considered safe for individuals with specific 
conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, solid organ transplant 
recipients, children, pregnant individuals, and those with hematologic problems. 
Ultimately, the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among individuals is 
influenced by various factors, including geographic, socioeconomic, and 
pandemic-related considerations."

"BACKGROUND: Research on the specific pathways from maternal nurturance to early 
child development remains limited. Grounded in transactional theory, this study 
is the first to examine these pathways through the parent-child relationship.
METHODS: This longitudinal study involved mothers of children aged 1-3 years. 
Data on sociodemographic characteristics, Comprehensive General Parenting 
Questionnaire, and Child-Parent Relationship Scale were collected at Time 1, 
when children were 1 year old. At Time 2, when children were 3 years old, 
Caregiver-Reported Early Development Instruments were measured. Structural 
equation modeling (SEM) was used to explore direct and indirect pathways from 
maternal nurturance to early child development.
RESULTS: A total of 1145 mother-child dyads participated, with children 
averaging 32 months (SD = 6.4) and mothers averaging 28.7 years (SD = 4.0). 
Maternal nurturance had significant direct (β = 0.271), indirect (β = 0.065), 
and total (β = 0.336) effects on early child development. Direct effects 
accounted for 80.7% of the total effects, while indirect effects accounted for 
19.3%. Maternal nurturance indirectly predicted higher early child development 
through increased parent-child closeness (β = 0.048), explaining 14.3% of the 
total effects. Maternal nurturance indirectly promoted early child development 
through reduced parent-child conflict (β = 0.017), explaining 5.1% of the total 
effects.
CONCLUSION: The novelty of this study lies in its demonstration of the mediating 
role of the parent-child relationship in the effect of maternal nurturance on 
early child development. This longitudinal study provides insights for 
governments agencies, policymakers, and healthcare workers to develop 
intervention programs that enhance maternal nurturance through the parent-child 
relationship to promote early child development."

"INTRODUCTION: The term ""post-COVID-19 syndrome"" describes a range of symptoms 
persisting beyond the acute phase of the disease. These symptoms predominantly 
include fatigue, muscle pain, shortness of breath, and psychological issues. 
Research additionally suggests the possibility of long-term neurological and 
psychiatric impairment associated with COVID-19.
METHODOLOGY: The study included patients who visited the post-COVID outpatient 
clinic between April 2020 and June 2022. The examination included the detailed 
history taking, including the COVID-19 course, posteroanterior chest X-ray and 
pulmonary function tests. Anxiety level was assessed using the Beck Anxiety 
Inventory (BAI). The relationship between anxiety, demographic data, and course 
of the disease, need for hospital admission during the acute phase, oxygen 
therapy, post-inflammatory changes on the chest X-ray and lung function 
parameters was investigated.
RESULTS: This study included 1756 patients who experienced COVID-19 and visited 
a post-COVID outpatient clinic. The majority of individuals experienced a mild 
form of the infection. The results showed that younger age and female gender 
were associated with significantly higher anxiety scores. Inpatients had lower 
BAI values than those who were not hospitalized during acute phase. Patients 
with post-inflammatory changes on chest X-ray had surprisingly lower BAI values. 
Lower values of FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), DLCO (diffusing 
capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide), and KCO (carbon monoxide transfer 
coefficient) were associated with significantly higher BAI values. Female gender 
was associated with higher levels of anxiety. In contrast, higher FEV1 values 
reduced the risk of a pathological level of anxiety.
CONCLUSION: In our study, the influence of age, gender, inpatient care during 
the acute phase of infection, the presence of post-inflammatory changes on the 
chest diagram and selected parameters of lung function (FEV1, DLCO, and KCO) 
were shown to be important factors in the assessment of anxiety symptoms in 
post-COVID patients."

"Background: Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP) is a hematological disorder, 
where its primary cause is unknown. This can be triggered through any secondary 
underlying diseases or other environmental agents such as drugs, vaccination, 
natural viral infections etc. After the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, a 
4-fold increase in ITP cases was observed globally. Many of the COVID-19 
vaccines such as m-RNA and viral-vector vaccines already demonstrated a 
cause-effect relationship between the event of ITP and immunization. Case 
presentation: A 54 year old diabetic patient presented to the hospital with 
complaints of gum bleeding and fatigue. He was diagnosed with severe ITP 
following COVID-19 vaccination with a platelet count of 5000 cumm. Initially his 
condition was considered as idiopathic and the COVID-19 vaccine exposure 
(13 days prior to the clinical presentation) was not suspected. Later the 
immunization timeline and onset of the reaction was traced by his hematologist. 
The patient underwent multiple platelet transfusions and was given 
corticosteroid therapy. The patient was followed for a period of 1 year and 
throughout the follow-up period the patient had fluctuating platelets count, 
especially after tapering steroids. Conclusion: ITP in this case is found to 
have a consistent causal association to COVID-19 vaccination as per the World 
Health Organization Causality assessment algorithm and is categorized under 
vaccine product related reactions. One year follow-up conducted showed that the 
thrombocytopenia following COVID-19 vaccine may be prolonged."

"INTRODUCTION: This scoping review study was conducted with the aim of 
identifying dimensions of trust in medical care, common trust subjects, and 
medical trust correlates among available instruments.
METHODS: We carried out a scoping review of literature through Medline, EMBASE, 
Scopus, Google Scholar engine, and various information sources of grey 
literature, to identify eligible studies up to 2023. We merely included 
psychometric studies in these areas. Non-psychometrics studies were excluded. 
Two assessors independently and carefully chose papers and abstracted records 
for qualitative exploration.
RESULTS: Fifty-two studies (n=37228 participants) were included in the review. 
The majority of the participants 67 % (24943) were adults (≥18). 
One-dimensionality trust was found in 36 % (19) of trust in medical care 
studies, while multidimensionality was identified in 64 % (33) of the studies. 
Ten categories of trust in medicine correlates or associates were identified. In 
terms of trust scales subjects, about 71 % (37) of the scales measured trust in 
healthcare professions, 14 % (7) health care systems, and the rest were about 
emergency department, trauma care emergency department, health care team, 
technology, authorities, telemedicine, insurer, COVID-19 prevention policies, 
performance, and general trust.
CONCLUSION: Various tools have been developed and validated in the field of 
trust in healthcare, and several domains have been identified. Trust in medicine 
is correlated by a variety of factors such as patient characteristics, 
healthcare provider factors, healthcare organization features, health 
conditions, and social influences. It is suggested that researchers pay more 
attention to the most commonly known dimensions in preparing tools."

"INTRODUCTION: Pregnant women and their fetuses are considered as high-risk 
groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to identify the 
risk factors of adverse pregnancy outcomes among women with COVID-19.
METHODS: This case-control study was conducted among pregnant women who 
delivered live infants at least 60 days before data collection in Hormozgan 
Province, south of Iran, 2021. The case and control groups included women with 
and without the history of COVID-19, respectively. A 47-item checklist including 
demographic information of the mothers, maternal current and past medical 
history, maternal and fetal prenatal and post-natal outcomes; and other COVID-19 
related outcomes was used. The logistic regression analysis was used for data 
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1337 women (668 in case and 669 in control groups) 
participated in this study. The mean (SD) gestational age in the case and 
control groups were 32.83 (84.64) and 23.75 (6.93) weeks respectively. Maternal 
age and the incidence of abortion, obesity, and multiple pregnancies was higher 
in the COVID-19 group compared with the control group. The most common COVID-19 
symptoms were myalgia (24.8%), cough (19.3%), fever (17.5%) and olfactory 
disorder (14.3%). The preventive factors against COVID-19 adverse pregnancy 
outcomes were low and normal body mass index, influenza vaccination history, and 
multivitamin consumption, while the risk factors were multiple pregnancies, 
abortion and preterm labor.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that pregnant women were to COVID-19. The 
identified risk factors for COVID-19 adverse pregnancy outcomes can be used to 
prioritized pregnant women in receiving COVID-19 related health services."

"The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the lack of infection prevention and control (IPC) 
infrastructure among long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in the United States; the 
situation in Alabama is particularly dire with LTCFs receiving some of the 
lowest quality ratings in the country. Alabama's LTCFs continue to be challenged 
by frequent staff turnover, vaccine hesitancy, and reluctance to embrace new 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations such as 
enhanced barrier precautions. However, the American Rescue Plan of 2021 made 
funds available to states through a CDC Epidemiology and Laboratory (ELC) 
Cooperative Agreement to promote IPC system improvement, including the creation 
of the Alabama Nursing Home and Long-Term Care Strike Team (LTC Strike Team). In 
this article, we reviewed preliminary data from Alabama for the first year of 
the 2-year cooperative agreement cycle (2022--2023). Data included activity 
tracking by Infection Preventionists (IPs) and evaluations submitted voluntarily 
by LTCFs upon completion of trainings and/or direct services provided by the LTC 
Strike Team. Results indicated a significant need for IPC training among LTCFs 
and a high level of satisfaction with the services provided by IPs. Despite 
successes, it is unclear if future funding will be available to support 
long-term sustainability efforts."

"Pandemics like COVID-19 have highlighted the potential of Photoacoustic imaging 
(PAI) for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) communication and lung diagnostics. 
However, PAI struggles with the clear imaging of blood vessels in areas like the 
lungs and brain due to their cavity structures. This paper presents a simulation 
model to analyze the generation and propagation mechanism within phantom tissues 
of PAI artifacts, focusing on the evaluation of both Anisotropic diffusion 
filtering (ADF) and Non-local mean (NLM) filtering, which significantly reduce 
noise and eliminate artifacts and signify a pivotal point for selecting 
artifact-removal algorithms under varying conditions of light distribution. 
Experimental validation demonstrated the efficacy of our technique, elucidating 
the effect of light source uniformity on artifact-removal performance. The NLM 
filtering simulation and ADF experimental validation increased the peak 
signal-to-noise ratio by 11.33% and 18.1%, respectively. The proposed technique 
adds a promising dimension for BCI and is an accurate imaging solution for 
diagnosing lung diseases."

"OBJECTIVE: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, hospital visitation restrictions 
hindered patients' access to vital social support. This study explores the 
impact and feasibility of a student-led program facilitating audiovisual 
communication between inpatient rehabilitation patients and their caregivers.
METHODS: The study design employed a prospective observational approach, and 
convenience sampling enrolled 99 participants, including 33 patients, 33 
caregivers, and 33 medical students. From September 2021 to March 2022, eligible 
patients admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital identified a caregiver 
and participated in a 30-minute audiovisual call organized by a medical student. 
Post-visit surveys via RedCap were completed by all participants and covered 
limitations in video calls, program benefits, comfort levels in video 
conferencing, and overall program ratings. The study adopted a quantitative 
research paradigm for data analysis. Statistical analysis utilized pairwise 
McNemar's and Wilcoxon's test for inter-group comparison.
RESULTS: Patients, caregivers, and medical students all reported positive 
outcomes in program offerings including providing social support, decreasing 
feelings of isolation, and providing a feeling of connection. Patients rated the 
program 4.82 ± 0.47 on a Likert scale, with 97% recommending it to others, even 
beyond visitation restrictions. The most common diagnosis among patients was 
stroke (30%), highlighting the program's potential applicability across diverse 
patient populations. Caregivers rated the program 4.59 ± 0.87 and expressed a 
desire for its continuation post-restrictions (80%). Medical students (81%) 
recommended the program, citing benefits in reducing social isolation and 
gaining clinical experience. No statistical differences were observed between 
groups in emotional and humanistic domains.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential for programs to utilize 
technology to address social isolation in the healthcare setting. When public 
health restrictions occur, medical educators should consider opportunities to 
support and foster innovation for student-led programs. Further research should 
explore broader impacts on healthcare outcomes and medical education."

"OBJECTIVES: To describe the carriage rate, serotype distribution, and 
antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. 
pneumoniae) nasopharyngeal (NP) isolates among healthy children aged 30 days to 
<60 months in the cities of Beijing and Shenzhen during 2018-2021.
METHODS: A NP swab sample was collected among four annual cohorts of healthy 
children at routine well-child visits. S. pneumoniae was identified by culture, 
optochin sensitivity and bile solubility, serotypes determined by latex 
agglutination and Quellung, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed 
using E-test strips.
RESULTS: S. pneumoniae NP carriage was 13.1% (645/4,911), with the highest S. 
pneumoniae carriage prevalence (15.3%) observed in 25 to <60 months. The 
carriage prevalence was 15.1% in children 13-24 months, 13.2% in children 7-12 
months, and 8.2% in children 30 days to 6 months (P < 0.01). Living with 
siblings [20.0% vs. 9.4%: OR: 2.42 (95% CI: 2.05-2.87)] or attending day-care 
[31.8% vs. 11.3%: OR: 3.67 (95% CI: 2.94-4.57)] increased the risk (P < 0.01). 
During the period (January 2020-April 2021) of strict non-pharmaceutical 
interventions to prevent and control the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of 
children with S. pneumoniae colonization declined from 16.0% (94/587) to 5.8% 
(108/1,848) in Beijing while increasing from 14.5% (64/443) to 18.6% (379/2,033) 
in Shenzhen. Among S. pneumoniae isolates, 36.7% (237/645) belonged to 13-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) serotypes, 64.3% (408/645) were non-PCV13 
serotypes, including 20.8% (134/645) non-serotypeable S. pneumoniae (NST). A 
total of 158/644 isolates (24.5%) were MDR. For the PCV13 isolates, MDR was 
detected in 36.3% (86/237) of isolates; in comparison, 17.6% (72/407) of 
non-PCV13 serotypes, including NST, were MDR (P < 0.01). S. pneumoniae NP 
carriage was detected in 10.7% of children with previous pneumococcal 
vaccination (PCV7 or PCV13 only) compared with 14.9% in children without 
previous pneumococcal vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: The highest S. pneumoniae carriage prevalence were found in the 
oldest age group (25 to <60 months) and in children living with siblings or 
attending day-care. Vaccination with PCV7 or PCV13 was associated with lower 
PCV13-serotype colonization. In Beijing, S. pneumoniae carriage significantly 
declined during the COVID-19 pandemic."

"The World Health Organization has declared ""with great hope"" an end to COVID-19 
as a public health emergency. The vaccination drive that started in December 
2020 played a crucial role in controlling the pandemic. However, the pace at 
which COVID-19 vaccines were developed and deployed for general population use 
led to vaccine hesitancy, largely owing to concerns regarding the safety and 
efficacy of the vaccines. Radiology has been instrumental in demonstrating the 
extent of pulmonary involvement and identification of the complications of 
COVID-19, and the same holds true for vaccine-related complications. This review 
summarizes the existing body of radiological literature regarding the efficacy, 
adverse events, and imaging pitfalls that accompany the global rollout of 
various COVID-19 vaccines."

"OBJECTIVES: Wastewater-based surveillance applied to SARS-CoV-2 viral load 
quantification for COVID-19 has become one of the most relevant complementary 
tools in epidemiologic prevention programs worldwide. However, this valuable 
decision-making tool still requires fine-tuning to produce comparable results 
between laboratories, especially when applied to the surveillance of megacities.
METHODS: Six laboratories across Mexico and one from the United States executed 
an interlaboratory study to set up a singular standardized protocol considering 
method cost, installed infrastructure, materials available, and supply 
availability for SARS-CoV-2 quantification from five Mexico City sampling sites 
across this megacity.
RESULTS: Comparable data from processing outcomes in the Mexican laboratories 
and in the external international laboratory serve as a validating data source. 
The Bland-Altman comparison showed consistency, with cycle threshold values 
within ±1.96 SD of SARS-CoV-2 genetic copies for the standard curve 
quantification, with a mismatch of two laboratories. In addition, MS2 
bacteriophage recovery rates varied between 35% and 67% among all participating 
laboratories. Finally, the efficiency of viral genetic material recovered from 
all participating laboratories varied between 65% and 93% for the participating 
laboratories.
CONCLUSION: This work lays the foundation for extensive and continuous 
wastewater-based surveillance application across independent Mexican 
laboratories in a time- and resource-effective manner."

"Post-coronavirus disease condition (PCC) continues to affect many people 
globally, yet there remains a lack of diagnostic biomarkers to distinguish PCC 
from those recovered from acute COVID-19. This study compared biomarkers between 
two age- and gender-matched groups: PCC individuals and those recovered within 
three months of acute COVID-19 in 2020 (n = 85 each). Biomarkers were assessed 
12-24 months after initial diagnosis, examining biochemical profiles, blood cell 
counts, coagulation status, antibody serology, lymphocyte populations, and 
cytokine levels. PCC individuals exhibited significant alterations in 49 of 167 
markers, including K+ levels, αGAD antibodies, antithrombin III, insulin-like 
growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), and interleukin-10 (IL-10). A panel of 
αGAD, IL-10, potassium levels, and CD16brightCD56- cell presence distinguished 
PCC individuals from recovered patients with >88% accuracy and <92% precision."

"INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer screening (LCS) reduces lung cancer mortality, yet 
uptake pre- and post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains low. The impact 
of COVID-19 on LCS programs across the United States is unknown. Ours is the 
first multi-institutional study to identify barriers to LCS experienced during 
the pandemic. Our work will hopefully inform the development of targeted 
resources to facilitate increased uptake of LCS.
METHODS: A nationwide survey of Centers of Excellence (SCOE) in LCS was 
conducted by GO2 for Lung Cancer Foundation. In 2021, survey items included 
questions regarding program structure, screening rates, and systemic barriers to 
LCS delivery experienced amid COVID-19.
RESULTS: A total of 99 programs representing 1112 screening sites responded. A 
median of 868 patients were screened during the year of 2020. Patient 
recruitment, patient education, and in-person service access were negatively 
affected by COVID-19, whereas the use of telemedicine was positively affected. 
Coordination of care and timely reporting of results were largely unaffected by 
the pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a real-world snapshot of how COVID-19 affected 
LCS from a program perspective. These findings highlight ongoing challenges with 
educating and engaging those at high risk for lung cancer in LCS. Program 
resources should be directed toward increasing adherence to LCS among eligible 
patients."

"PURPOSE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect 
the human placenta and has been shown to have an adverse effect on Doppler 
ultrasound parameters and placental features. However, the specific effects of 
the SAS-CoV-2 infection on the fetal-placental unit in pregnant women remain 
unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the 
impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on Doppler ultrasound and placental findings in 
pregnant women.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using four electronic databases 
(PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) to select publications published 
in peer-reviewed journals written in English. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated, 
along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed 
using Cochrane Q and I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistics and the appropriate 
P-value. The analysis used RevMan 5.3.
RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 1,210 pregnant women from 10 case-control 
studies. SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women exhibited higher likelihoods of 
placental abnormalities (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.66 to 4.13), aberrant Doppler 
values (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.16 to 3.27), an abnormal cerebroplacental ratio (OR, 
2.68; 95% CI, 1.52 to 4.75), altered fetoplacental circulation (OR, 1.56; 95% 
CI, 1.07 to 2.28), and increased placental thickness and placental venous lakes 
(OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.72).
CONCLUSION: According to this meta-analysis, pregnant women infected with 
SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to experience altered Doppler ultrasonography 
parameters and placental abnormalities, including increased placental thickness, 
placental venous lakes, altered fetoplacental circulation, and cerebroplacental 
ratio. However, the limited number of case-control studies requires larger 
sample sizes to validate and enhance the evidence."

"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of acupuncture combined 
with bloodletting therapy and Qingwen Xiere decoction in mild to moderate 
COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: A total of 100 mild to moderate COVID-19 patients collected from 
December 2022 to February 2023 were randomly divided into control and 
observation groups, with 50 patients in each group. Patients in the control 
group received oral Qingwen Xiere decoction for 6 days. The observation group 
received acupuncture combined with bloodletting therapy in addition to oral 
Qingwen Xiere decoction, with the acupuncture (at Kongzui ［LU6］, Hegu ［LI4］, 
Quchi ［LI11］, Feishu ［BL13］, Zhongwan ［CV12］, Qihai ［CV6］, Yinlingquan ［SP9］) 
administered 30 min each day for 6 days, and bloodletting (at Shaoshang ［LU11］, 
Shangyang ［LI1］, Dazhui ［GV14］) administered every other day for 3 times. 
Traditional Chinese medicine syndrome scores and pulmonary CT scores were 
recorded before and after treatment. Serum contents of C-reactive protein (CRP), 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were measured 
using ELISA. Anxiety and depression degree were assessed using the Hamilton 
Depression Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Safety of the 
treatments was evaluated in both groups.
RESULTS: Compared with before treatment, after treatment, the control group 
showed improvement in fever, dry cough, sore throat, and total traditional 
Chinese medicine syndrome scores (P<0.01), but no significant improvement in 
muscle pain or fatigue；the observation group showed significant improvement in 
total traditional Chinese medicine syndrome and individual symptoms scores 
(P<0.01)；both groups demonstrated reductions in pulmonary CT scores, HAMA score, 
HAMD score and serum contents of CRP and IL-6 (P<0.01)；serum TNF-α content 
significantly decreased in the observation group (P<0.01). All outcome measures 
were superior in the observation group to the control group (P<0.01, P<0.05). No 
adverse reactions were reported in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture combined with bloodletting therapy and oral Qingwen 
Xiere decoction effectively improves clinical symptoms, alleviates pulmonary 
inflammatory injury, reduces inflammatory cytokine contents, and mitigates 
anxiety and depression in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients, and without 
adverse effects."

"EuCorVac-19 (ECV-19) is a recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) COVID-19 
vaccine that displays the RBD (derived from the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain) on 
immunogenic liposomes. This study compares the safety and immunogenicity of 
ECV-19 to the COVISHIELDTM (CS) adenoviral-vectored vaccine. Interim analysis is 
presented of a randomized, observer-blind, immunobridging Phase 3 trial in the 
Philippines in 2600 subjects, with treatment and biospecimen collection between 
October 2022 and January 2023. Healthy male and female adults who received 
investigational vaccines were 18 years and older, and randomly assigned to 
ECV-19 (n = 2004) or CS (n = 596) groups. Immunization followed a two-injection, 
intramuscular regimen with 4 weeks between prime and boost vaccination. Safety 
endpoints were assessed in all participants and immunogenicity analysis was 
carried out in a subset (n = 585 in ECV-19 and n = 290 in CS groups). The 
primary immunological endpoints were superiority of neutralizing antibody 
response, as well as noninferiority in seroresponse rate (defined as a 4-fold 
increase in RBD antibody titers from baseline). After prime vaccination, ECV-19 
had a lower incidence of local solicited adverse events (AEs) (12.0% vs. 15.8%, 
p < 0.01), and solicited systemic AEs (13.1 vs. 17.4%, p < 0.01) relative to CS. 
After the second injection, both ECV-19 and CS had lower overall solicited AEs 
(7.8% vs. 7.6%). For immunological assessment, 98% of participants had prior 
COVID-19 exposure (based on the presence of anti-nucleocapsid antibodies) at the 
time of the initial immunization, without differing baseline antibody levels or 
microneutralization (MN) titers against the Wuhan strain in the two groups. 
After prime vaccination, ECV-19 induced higher anti-RBD IgG relative to CS 
(1,464 vs. 355 BAU/mL, p < 0.001) and higher neutralizing antibody response 
(1,303 vs. 494 MN titer, p < 0.001). After boost vaccination, ECV-19 and CS 
maintained those levels of anti-RBD IgG (1367 vs. 344 BAU/mL, p < 0.001) and 
neutralizing antibodies (1128 vs. 469 MN titer, p < 0.001). ECV-19 also elicited 
antibodies that better neutralized the Omicron variant, compared to CS (763 vs. 
373 MN titer, p < 0.001). Women displayed higher responses to both vaccines than 
men. The ECV-19 group had a greater seroresponse rate compared to CS (83% vs. 
30%, p < 0.001). In summary, both ECV-19 and CS had favorable safety profiles, 
with ECV-19 showing diminished local and systemic solicited AE after prime 
immunization. ECV-19 had significantly greater immunogenicity in terms of 
anti-RBD IgG, neutralizing antibodies, and seroresponse rate. These data 
establish a relatively favorable safety and immunogenicity profile for ECV-19. 
The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05572879)."

"ISSUE ADDRESSED: International students are at a heightened risk of experiencing 
negative health and wellbeing outcomes, which was further exacerbated during the 
COVID-19 lockdowns. This research sought to explore the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on the health and wellbeing of international students in Australia.
METHODS: Thirty-one international students participated in qualitative in-depth 
interviews between March and April 2022 to explore their experiences of health 
and wellbeing during 2020-2021 while they lived and studied in Australia. 
Interviews were coded and analysed thematically using NVivo software.
RESULTS: Findings highlight the impact of the pandemic on international 
students' mental, social and financial wellbeing, including worry about loved 
ones, social isolation, financial and employment insecurity and challenges 
related to online learning. The pandemic exacerbated and brought more attention 
to existing issues and placed students in unequal positions in relation to 
domestic students and each other.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased students' vulnerability to poor 
mental health and to a range of social and financial issues. SO WHAT?: The 
findings of this study highlight the need for support strategies to improve 
international students' mental health and social wellbeing outcomes in 
Australia."

"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can cause various complications. We 
report a case of severe COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a 
patient receiving veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO), 
complicated by Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and cerebral infarction, as well as 
pulmonary embolism. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old Japanese man with a history of 
ulcerative colitis was admitted for COVID-19. His respiratory status worsened 
and progressed to ARDS, requiring intubation on hospital day (HD) 3. On HD 16, 
contrast computed tomography revealed PE. On HD 18, his respiratory condition 
worsened, and V-V ECMO was initiated. On HD 23, V-V ECMO was successfully 
discontinued. He regained consciousness on HD 44, but he had quadriplegia. 
Deep-tendon reflexes were absent in all limbs. Cranial nerve involvement, 
specifically bilateral facial nerve weakness, was noted. Magnetic resonance 
imaging showed bilateral scattered cerebral infarctions on HD 76. Nerve 
conduction studies indicated severe axonal neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid 
examination showed albuminocytologic dissociation. The antibody to the 
ganglioside GD1a was positive. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis 
of GBS. He received immunoglobulin treatment on HD 89, and his neurological 
findings slightly improved. CONCLUSIONS This study emphasized that in COVID-19, 
neurological complications are not rare, are difficult to diagnose, and are 
prone to delays in detection."

"INTRODUCTION: The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 significantly impacted human 
life around the globe. Numerous unexpected modifications of the SARS-CoV-2 
genome have resulted in the emergence of new types and have caused great concern 
globally.
METHOD: Inhibitory effects of bioactive phytochemicals derived from natural and 
synthetic sources are promising for pathogenic viruses. in vitro and in silico 
techniques were used in the current study to identify novel inhibitors of 
coumarin clubbed thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazoles against the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein.
RESULT: Interestingly, all the tested molecules demonstrated substantial 
inhibition of spike protein with 91.81-57.90% inhibition. The spike protein was 
remarkably inhibited by compounds 6k (91.83%), 6j (89.75%), 6m (87.69%),6i 
(86.60%), 6l (85.40%), 6h (84.70%), 6l (84.70%), 6g (83.40%), 6b (82.60%), 6f 
(81.90%), while compounds 6d 6a, 6c, and 6e exhibited significant activity 
against spike protein with 79.60%, 77.10%, 75.30%, and 57.90% inhibition, 
respectively. The binding mechanism of these novel inhibitors with spike protein 
was deduced in silico, which reflects that the active molecules firmly bind with 
the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, thereby inhibiting its 
function.
CONCLUSION: The combined in vitro and in silico investigations unfold the 
therapeutic potential of coumarin-thiazolotriazole scaffolds in the treatment of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection."

"INTRODUCTION: Cognitive changes are very frequently reported by people with 
post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS), but there is limited understanding of the 
underpinning mechanisms leading to these difficulties. It is possible that 
cognitive difficulties are related to immune status and/or low mood. The aim of 
the present study was to examine the relationship between immune status and 
cognitive functioning in PCS, while considering whether depression symptoms also 
influence this association.
METHODS: Participants were recruited in an online study of cognitive and 
psychological consequences of PCS, involving individuals attending a post-COVID 
clinic in an acute general hospital in Ireland, and a comparison sample of age- 
and sex-matched community controls who had also been infected with COVID-19 but 
had not experienced PCS. Participants with PCS (n = 71) and community controls 
(n = 50) completed the immune status questionnaire, Cognitive Failures 
Questionnaire (CFQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F).
RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between groups in terms of 
perceived immune status, perceived cognitive function, depression scores, and 
fatigue, with the ""PCS"" group reporting lower immune status, more cognitive 
difficulties, and higher levels of depression and fatigue. Regression analysis 
in the PCS group indicated that immune status and depression significantly 
contributed to variance in subjective cognitive functioning, with immune status 
remaining a significant predictor of cognitive functioning scores even when 
accounting for depression, fatigue, and other covariates related to PCS, such as 
Body Mass Index (BMI).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that subjective cognitive functioning is 
influenced by self-reported immune status in PCS, emphasising the importance of 
immune status, cognitive, and mood screening as part of routine clinical care in 
PCS."

"Studying the genetic regulation of protein expression (through protein 
quantitative trait loci (pQTLs)) offers a deeper understanding of regulatory 
variants uncharacterized by mRNA expression regulation (expression QTLs (eQTLs)) 
studies. Here we report cis-eQTL and cis-pQTL statistical fine-mapping from 
1,405 genotyped samples with blood mRNA and 2,932 plasma samples of protein 
expression, as part of the Japan COVID-19 Task Force (JCTF). Fine-mapped eQTLs 
(n = 3,464) were enriched for 932 variants validated with a massively parallel 
reporter assay. Fine-mapped pQTLs (n = 582) were enriched for missense 
variations on structured and extracellular domains, although the possibility of 
epitope-binding artifacts remains. Trans-eQTL and trans-pQTL analysis 
highlighted associations of class I HLA allele variation with KIR genes. We 
contrast the multi-tissue origin of plasma protein with blood mRNA, contributing 
to the limited colocalization level, distinct regulatory mechanisms and trait 
relevance of eQTLs and pQTLs. We report a negative correlation between ABO mRNA 
and protein expression because of linkage disequilibrium between distinct nearby 
eQTLs and pQTLs."

"BACKGROUND: In late 2019, a new respiratory illness was detected in Wuhan, China 
and was later designated as COVID-19 by the WHO. Despite international efforts 
to impose restrictions and quarantine measures, the virus spreads rapidly across 
the globe. The pandemic has significantly impacted the mental health of both 
children and parents. This study investigates the relationship between parents' 
anxiety, stress and depression, and Children's Health-Related Quality of Life 
(CHQol) and externalised behavioural disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that included 396 parents who have 
children between the ages of 6 and 18 years old. Sampling was done by designing 
an online questionnaire that was distributed on social media (WhatsApp and 
Telegram and native social media, such as Eitaa, Soroush and E-Gap). Inclusion 
criteria were all citizens living in rural and urban areas of Rafsanjan, 
citizens living in Rafsanjan city for 1 year and having children aged 6-18 years 
old. We used a demographic information questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety, 
Stress Scale-21, CHQol and Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment to 
collect data.
RESULTS: We found a positive significant correlation between anxiety (r=0.334), 
stress (r=0.354), depression (r=0.324) and externalised behavioural disorder 
(p<0.001). Depression and anxiety predicted 22% of the variance of the CHQol 
(p<0.001) while age, stress, use of masks and gloves to prevent infection, and 
anxiety predicted 19% of the variance of externalised behavioural disorder 
(p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Parents experienced high levels of symptoms of anxiety, stress and 
depression during the COVID-19 outbreak, which can be associated with 
behavioural disorders in their children and negatively impact their health. 
Therefore, it is crucial to pay more attention to the mental state of parents 
and its complications for children."

"BACKGROUND: Translating findings from animal models to human disease is 
essential for dissecting disease mechanisms, developing and testing precise 
therapeutic strategies. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has 
highlighted this need, particularly for models showing disease 
severity-dependent immune responses.
METHODS: Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) is well poised to reveal 
similarities and differences between species at the molecular and cellular level 
with unprecedented resolution. However, computational methods enabling detailed 
matching are still scarce. Here, we provide a structured scRNAseq-based approach 
that we applied to scRNAseq from blood leukocytes originating from humans and 
hamsters affected with moderate or severe COVID-19.
FINDINGS: Integration of data from patients with COVID-19 with two hamster 
models that develop moderate (Syrian hamster, Mesocricetus auratus) or severe 
(Roborovski hamster, Phodopus roborovskii) disease revealed that most cellular 
states are shared across species. A neural network-based analysis using 
variational autoencoders quantified the overall transcriptomic similarity across 
species and severity levels, showing highest similarity between neutrophils of 
Roborovski hamsters and patients with severe COVID-19, while Syrian hamsters 
better matched patients with moderate disease, particularly in classical 
monocytes. We further used transcriptome-wide differential expression analysis 
to identify which disease stages and cell types display strongest 
transcriptional changes.
INTERPRETATION: Consistently, hamsters' response to COVID-19 was most similar to 
humans in monocytes and neutrophils. Disease-linked pathways found in all 
species specifically related to interferon response or inhibition of viral 
replication. Analysis of candidate genes and signatures supported the results. 
Our structured neural network-supported workflow could be applied to other 
diseases, allowing better identification of suitable animal models with similar 
pathomechanisms across species.

"INTRODUCTION: The pandemic has highlighted a worsening of nurses' working 
conditions and a global nursing shortage. Little is known about the factors, 
strategies and interventions that improve nurse retention in the peri-COVID and 
post-COVID time period. An improved understanding of approaches implemented to 
support and retain nurses will provide a blueprint for sustaining the nursing 
workforce. The objectives of this scoping review are to investigate and describe 
the following: (a) factors associated with nurse retention; (b) strategies 
suggested to support nurse retention and (c) interventions trialled to support 
nurse retention, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus will be searched. The 
included studies will be qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods and grey 
literature studies of nurses including factors, strategies and/or interventions 
to support nurse retention in the peri-COVID and post-COVID time period (2019 to 
present) that are in English or can be translated into English. The excluded 
studies will be those that focus on nurse managers, educators, students or those 
in advanced practice roles and studies where the population cannot be segmented 
to identify which data came from nurses. Systematic, scoping reviews and 
meta-syntheses will be excluded, but their reference lists will be hand-screened 
for suitable studies. Data will be evaluated for quality and synthesised 
qualitatively to map the current evidence available. The relevant studies will 
be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval for the broader research study, including 
this scoping review, has been obtained from the university health sciences 
research board (protocol #00042510). All data for this scoping review will be 
collected from published literature, and findings will be published in a 
peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant conferences.

"A man in late adolescence of Asian descent was admitted with cardiac-sounding 
chest pain and a history of flu-like symptoms a week prior to presentation with 
negative screening for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. His ECG showed lateral T-wave 
changes and pre-excitation pattern suggestive of an accessory pathway. 
High-sensitivity troponin T peak was significantly elevated to 2550 ng/L (normal 
reference range 0-11). He was initially treated for a suspected perimyocarditis. 
Transthoracic echocardiography revealed moderate left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of coronary 
artery disease. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed subendocardial delayed 
gadolinium enhancement with ischaemia and viability in the left circumflex (LCx) 
territory. He was then sent for a CT coronary angiogram for a suspected 
spontaneous coronary artery dissection, and subsequently, he discussed with our 
team and accepted for immediate transfer. He underwent coronary angiography and 
intravascular ultrasound-guided percutaneous coronary intervention to his LCx 
artery with a drug-coated balloon. Following that, and after a discussion with 
the electrophysiology team, he had an attempt at ablating his accessory pathway 
with partial success. He was discharged home in a stable condition."

"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Most Regional Anesthesiology and Acute Pain Medicine 
(RAAPM) fellowship programs transitioned to virtual interviews in 2020 because 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, the RAAPM fellowship match started in 2023 in 
order to make the application process more equitable. In this study, we surveyed 
RAAPM fellowship program directors (PDs) to determine how such major events of 
the early 2020s shaped the fellowship application process.
METHODS: A 16-question survey was distributed to US RAAPM program directors. The 
survey aimed to assess whether PDs prefer the fellowship match over the previous 
rolling application format and to gauge PDs' confidence in using virtual 
interviews to evaluate applicants.
RESULTS: 56 (71%) RAAPM program directors completed the survey. 79% of 
respondents participated in the inaugural match. 59% of PDs preferred the 
fellowship match over the rolling application format. The interview was rated 
the most important selection criterion. Of the 93% of PDs who switched to 
virtual interviews during the pandemic, only 4 PDs (7%) resumed in-person 
interviews in some capacity. Majority of PDs believed that virtual interviews 
were not inferior to in-person interviews for assessing applicants; 48% of 
respondents preferred virtual interviews over in-person interviews.
CONCLUSIONS: Most RAAPM programs continued to conduct virtual interviews 
exclusively. Majority of program directors preferred the fellowship match. PDs 
ranked the interview as the most important selection factor. Most PDs thought 
virtual interviews were not inferior to in-person interviews, but they remained 
divided on which format they prefer."

"BACKGROUND: Evidence on quality of care and sociodemographics in patients with 
COPD needing care during the COVID-19 pandemic is scarce. We aimed to examine 
indicators of quality and clinical outcomes (eg, readmissions, death) and 
sociodemographics in patients with COPD in need of hospital care during the 
COVID-19 pandemic compared to before the pandemic.
METHODS: This was a nationwide register-based study of subjects with a hospital 
contact due to COPD from January 1, 2015-December 15, 2021, in Denmark. A 
generalized linear model using Poisson distribution was used to estimate 
prevalence ratios (PRs) for variables of interest.
RESULTS: During the pandemic, the early average of admissions was 36% lower than 
before the pandemic; the average number of out-patients was 23% lower. The 
proportion of readmissions for exacerbation within 30 d of discharge decreased 
during the pandemic (PR 0.93 [95% CI 0.90-0.96]). The proportion of subjects who 
died within 30 d of admission remained unchanged (PR 0.98 [0.94-1.03]). Among 
out-patients, the proportion with 2 or more exacerbations in the preceding year 
was lower during the pandemic (PR 0.82 [0.80-0.84]). During the pandemic, both 
in-patients and out-patients were less likely to be younger, to live alone, and 
to have a lower educational level.
CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide study of subjects with COPD, hospital contacts 
decreased during the pandemic due to lockdowns and isolation, which led to a 
decrease in infections overall in the society. Meanwhile, in-hospital care 
remained unaltered. However, concerns are raised about patients with COPD and 
low educational level and immigrants not seeking relevant health care."

"INTRODUCTION: The threat of new, emerging, and multidrug-resistant microbes is 
increasing which has created the necessity for new antimicrobials. In this 
regard, nanotechnology can be an alternative for the treatment of infectious 
microbes. Curcumin has been used since ancient times as antimicrobials; however, 
it has limitations due to its less aqueous solubility, bioavailability, and 
biocompatibility. This problem can be solved by curcumin-derived carbon nanodots 
which are emerging antimicrobials of <10 nm size, water-soluble, biocompatible, 
less toxic, and fluorescent.
AREA COVERED: The review discusses the application of curcumin-derived carbon 
nanodots against various pathogenic microbes including bacteria and dreaded 
viruses like SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the role of curcumin carbon nanodots in 
biolabelling of pathogenic microbes, mechanism of action, bioimaging, and 
therapy has been critically examined.
EXPERT OPINION: Carbon nanodots play an important role in combating pathogenic 
microbes by early diagnosis, bioimaging, nanocarrier for antimicrobial drugs, 
and therapy of infectious diseases. Curcumin carbon nanodots have already 
demonstrated their benefits of being water soluble, bioavailable, and 
biocompatible. However, more thorough research is needed to understand the 
efficacy and safety of curcumin carbon nanodots. In the future, curcumin-derived 
carbon nanodots can be used as alternative antimicrobial agents to fight 
microbial infections including multidrug-resistant microbes."

"Maderas Rainforest Conservancy (MRC) is a conservation non-profit organization 
that protects forests, offers primate field schools, and leads community 
outreach initiatives at sites in Central America, including La Suerte Biological 
Research Station (LSBRS) in Costa Rica. In 2018, MRC started Aula Verde, a 
conservation education initiative for elementary school students aged 5-12 at 
LSBRS. Groups of children from elementary schools and communities located within 
50 km have visited LSBRS from 2018-2023 to participate in the 1.5-2 hour Aula 
Verde workshop, which consists of (1) an interactive lecture on conservation, 
(2) a guided forest walk, and (3) a snack, gift bag, and tree seedling for each 
participant. Workshops are funded by international donations to MRC and cost US 
$8-16 per student. Aula Verde has been successful, with multiple schools and 
communities making repeat visits, students' families beginning to recycle their 
garbage and joining a WhatsApp group about conservation education that MRC staff 
initiated and lead, and teachers reporting improved learning outcomes for 
students who participate in the workshops. The success of Aula Verde is largely 
due to the ecological expertise and strong community ties of LSBRS staff. While 
the COVID-19 pandemic decreased Aula Verde offerings from 2020-2023, we expect 
workshops to resume at full capacity in 2024. In the future, MRC hopes to expand 
Aula Verde's outreach to all children aged 5-12 living within 50 km of LSBRS."
