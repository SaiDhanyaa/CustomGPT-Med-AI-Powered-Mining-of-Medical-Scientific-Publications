# CustomGPT-Med: AI-Powered Mining of Medical & Scientific Publications üöÄ

This project demonstrates how a custom fine-tuned GPT-based model can be used for mining scientific publications, clinical trial reports, and patents. It enables tasks like semantic search, named entity recognition (NER), automatic summarization, and question-answering for medical publications, pharmaceutical innovation, and healthcare research.
